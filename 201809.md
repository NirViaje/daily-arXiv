| 2018-09-04 | [Inferring the Composition of Disintegrating Planet Interiors from Dust Tails with Future James Webb Space Telescope Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07043) | + Investigated whether time-domain spectroscopy can be used to study the composition of disintegrating exoplanets <br> + It is possible, with most features around 10 micron; particles around the sizes of 1 micron will produce best signal (sub-micron particles are even better, but I think they will be blown out by the stellar wind) <br> + Systems with 0.5% transit depth in light-curves will produce features of about 1% significance in spectroscopic observation
| 2018-09-04 | [Dust in the Jupiter system outside the rings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10325) | + Medium-sized review of the dust population in the Jupiter system (excluding the ring): Galilean moons and Trojans, origins and dynamics <br> + Attention is paid to the hazard posed to future missions
| 2018-09-04 | [Dust Production and Depletion in Evolved Planetary Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09967) | + Investigated GD 56, a white dwarf (WD) system with varing infrared brightness over 11 years <br> + Observations in parallel with the idea that the GD 56 system is under "collisional cascade", an existing theory suggests that this might be due to instability of the WD atmosphere. Some others disvalid this theory but it is actually consistent with observation
