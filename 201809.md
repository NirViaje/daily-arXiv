| 2018-09-04 | [Inferring the Composition of Disintegrating Planet Interiors from Dust Tails with Future James Webb Space Telescope Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07043) | + Investigated whether time-domain spectroscopy can be used to study the composition of disintegrating exoplanets <br> + It is possible, with most features around 10 micron; particles around the sizes of 1 micron will produce best signal (sub-micron particles are even better, but I think they will be blown out by the stellar wind) <br> + Systems with 0.5% transit depth in light-curves will produce features of about 1% significance in spectroscopic observation
| 2018-09-04 | [Dust in the Jupiter system outside the rings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10325) | + Medium-sized review of the dust population in the Jupiter system (excluding the ring): Galilean moons and Trojans, origins and dynamics <br> + Attention is paid to the hazard posed to future missions
| 2018-09-04 | [Dust Production and Depletion in Evolved Planetary Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09967) | + Investigated GD 56, a white dwarf (WD) system with varing infrared brightness over 11 years <br> + Observations in parallel with the idea that the GD 56 system is under "collisional cascade", an existing theory suggests that this might be due to instability of the WD atmosphere. Some others disvalid this theory but it is actually consistent with observation
| 2018-09-11 | [A Survey of Water Production in 61 Comets from SOHO/SWAN Observations of Hydrogen Lyman-alpha: Twenty-One Years 1996-2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10865) | + Results largely consistent with A'Hearn et al. (1995): comets are more active post-perihelion <br> + For SPCs with known sizes, larger <em>q</em> objects tend to have larger active fraction, but power-law slope does not seen to depend on <em>q</em>. Large dispersion among long period comets <br> + Some trends showing that active fraction and power-law slope is related to comet evolution
| 2018-09-11 | [NELIOTA: The wide-field, high-cadence lunar monitoring system at the prime focus of the Kryoneri telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00495) | + NELIOTA is a high-cadence system based at the 1.2-m telescope at Athens and a two-color sCMOS camera, capable of reaching 18.7 mag with 10-s exposure. Field of view is only about 25% of visible lunar surface <br> + Demonstration work showing detection of lunar impact down to R=12 (integration time about 20 ms). Compared to the work of [Madiedo et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03193) who detected +7 mag flash and calculated that it was caused by a 3 kg meteoroid, a +12 mag flash should be caused by sub-kg meteoroid <br> + Detection rate is 1e-7 per km^2 per hr. The entire visible lunar surface is 2e7 km^2. So that means a detection rate of a few per hour
| 2018-09-11 | [A Novel Entry, Descent and Landing Architecture for Mars Landers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00062) | + Proposed a table-like lander with legs equipped with strong impact absorber
| 2018-09-11 | [A fast algorithm for the detection of faint orbital debris tracks in optical images](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00239) | + Another Radon transform code to find long streaks, with C code supplied
| 2018-09-13 | [Hubble Space Telescope Observations of 3200 Phaethon At Closest Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04713) | + Searched for 10-m-sized moonlets and dust trails near Phaethon, no detection <br> + Estimation of the lifetime of deep-burying ice on Phaethon, found that ice could survive for 26 Myr if the diffusivities is regolith-like, but it is too low to explain the property of the Geminid meteoroid
| 2018-09-13 | [Development of the Arizona Robotic Telescope Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01180) | Plan to automate a number of telescopes in Arizona, now starting with the 61" Kuiper telescope and the Vatican 1.8-m; using RTS2 and astropy's ccdproc
| 2018-09-16 | [The Mission Accessible Near-Earth Objects Survey: Four years of photometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03549) | +  The 4.5-year MANOS survey observed 228 NEOs and provided full or partial constraint for the rotational period/property of 103 NEOs <br> + Studied objects are in H=23 to 27 range; found two <30 s fast rotator, both at H=27 range <br> + Found that the number of elongated bodies is largely the same as spherical bodies <br> + Characterized two low-delta-v objects, one at H=23 and one at H=27
| 2018-09-17 | [Optical observations of NEA 3200 Phaethon (1983 TB) during the 2017 apparition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05900) | + Relay optical observation of Phaethon using several 0.4-2.0 m telescopes; derived rotation, shape and pole, which all agree with previous results <br> + Pole solution derived from two methods: light-curvey inversion and SAGE code [(briefly introduced here)](http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~tmueller/sbnaf/techniques/a_lightcurveinversion.html), both seem to without open source code
| 2018-09-17 | [Non-Gravitational Forces and Spin Evolution of Comets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05133) | + Suggested that non-gravitational forces would introduce spin evolution of comets; derived statistics based on observations of 7 comets, and applied it to all known periodical comets <br> + By deriving a relation between non-gravitational force and spin rate, author argued that objects with large non-gravitational force will reach spin break-up limit (myself: but it could also be the other way around, from an observer's point of view, that splitted comets exhibit large NG? Need to think into this), and show that the ones with large spin torque (2015 D1, 1999 J6, 205P) all behave strangely, though not all of them have broken up (1999 J6 hasn't)
| 2018-09-18 | [Spin Evolution and Cometary Interpretation of the Interstellar Minor Object 1I/2017 'Oumuamua](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06389) | + Following the paper about coupling of non-gravitational force and spin evolution yesterday, the slow spin rate of 'Oumuamua suggests that it does not have cometary activity
| 2018-09-20 | [The Draconid meteoroid stream 2018: prospects for satellite impact detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07393) | + Prediction of the Draconid activity in 2018 largely based on Vaubaillon's model <br> + Gaia at L2 might experience strong activity (ZHR=2400), though chance of getting meteoroid impact is still low (about 1 per km^2 per hour)
| 2018-09-20 | [TESS in the Solar System](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07403) | + TESS, like K2, can be used to study temporal changes to small bodies (mainly bright main-belters), either by direction observation of these asteroids or by flux excess of background stars. Showed some simulation how this could work
| 2018-09-20 | [The Origins Space Telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07351) | + OST is a slightly larger JWST but will cover 5-600 um. Goal is to search for biosignatures (in particular, planets orbiting M-type stars), observe young exoplanet systems to understand the evolution of planets, and study early universe. Planned instruments are 30-600 um spectrometer, MIR spectrometer and camera, FIR polarimeter, and 111-566 um spectrometer (called Heterodyne Receiver for OST) 
| 2018-09-24 | [The extraordinary composition of the "blue comet" C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08086) | + Optical spectroscopy and radio observations of C/2016 R2 <br> + Unusually strong CO, N2 and CO+, the latter two contribute to its blue color (emission lines blueward of 450 nm) <br> + Strong depletion of dust, water, and other common cometary volatiles
| 2018-09-24 | [Atmospheric turbulence forecasting with a General Circulation Model for Cerro Paranal](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08005) | + Used a GCM (EMCWF model) to calculate seeing for Paranal and compared the results to SCIDAR measurements, similar to Ye (2011)'s approach, but argued that Ye's model is related to an empirical parameter from the original Trinquin-Vernin model and thus limits its performance; the new model presented by the authors do not rely on any assumptions or empirically defined parameters, only a set of simplified physical model. Though the results are not significantly better (better by means, but the correlation is not much higher)
| 2018-09-24 | [Luminosity Function of Faint Sporadic Meteors measured with a Wide-Field CMOS mosaic camera Tomo-e PM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08816) | + Installed a CMOS mosaic camera on the Kiso Schmidt, consists of 8 CMOS chips and covers 2 deg^2 with an observation frequency of 2 Hz; this is a prototype of a larger camera consisting 84 CMOS chips and can cover 20 deg^2 <br> + System limiting magnitude is 18.5, but limiting magnitude for meteors is only about 12, or about +10 in absolute magnitude; sensitive to meteoroids down to 3e-7 kg <br> + Derived a brightness magnitude power-law index of 3.1+-0.4, so steeper than the sporadics in visual range <br> + Mentioned that some recent works have been looking at meteor trails in large survey data like SDSS
| 2018-09-24 | [Plausible home stars of the interstellar object 'Oumuamua found in Gaia DR2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09009) | + Searched for plausible host system of 'Oumuamua using the updated orbit of 'Oumuamua that includes non-gravitational effects (but this appearently assumes 'Oumuamua follows the non-gravitational solution before its encounter with the Solar System) <br> + Found a few <1 pc encounters, although the encounter speeds are a bit high and requires unlikely configuration of giant planets; alternatively binary system is much likely to produce the required ejection speed
| 2018-09-24 | [Galaxy morphology prediction using capsule networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08377) | + Capsule Network is a new type of neural network that was introduced in Oct 2017. Advantage over the traditional convolutional neural network: rotation and position of each feature is taking into account (using the authors' word: rotationally invariant and spatially aware) <br> + Implementation of capsul network in python: by [guam ai](https://github.com/gram-ai/capsule-networks)
