| 2018-09-04 | [Inferring the Composition of Disintegrating Planet Interiors from Dust Tails with Future James Webb Space Telescope Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07043) | + Investigated whether time-domain spectroscopy can be used to study the composition of disintegrating exoplanets <br> + It is possible, with most features around 10 micron; particles around the sizes of 1 micron will produce best signal (sub-micron particles are even better, but I think they will be blown out by the stellar wind) <br> + Systems with 0.5% transit depth in light-curves will produce features of about 1% significance in spectroscopic observation
| 2018-09-04 | [Dust in the Jupiter system outside the rings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10325) | + Medium-sized review of the dust population in the Jupiter system (excluding the ring): Galilean moons and Trojans, origins and dynamics <br> + Attention is paid to the hazard posed to future missions
| 2018-09-04 | [Dust Production and Depletion in Evolved Planetary Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09967) | + Investigated GD 56, a white dwarf (WD) system with varing infrared brightness over 11 years <br> + Observations in parallel with the idea that the GD 56 system is under "collisional cascade", an existing theory suggests that this might be due to instability of the WD atmosphere. Some others disvalid this theory but it is actually consistent with observation
| 2018-09-11 | [A Survey of Water Production in 61 Comets from SOHO/SWAN Observations of Hydrogen Lyman-alpha: Twenty-One Years 1996-2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10865) | + Results largely consistent with A'Hearn et al. (1995): comets are more active post-perihelion <br> + For SPCs with known sizes, larger <em>q</em> objects tend to have larger active fraction, but power-law slope does not seen to depend on <em>q</em>. Large dispersion among long period comets <br> + Some trends showing that active fraction and power-law slope is related to comet evolution
| 2018-09-11 | [NELIOTA: The wide-field, high-cadence lunar monitoring system at the prime focus of the Kryoneri telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00495) | + NELIOTA is a high-cadence system based at the 1.2-m telescope at Athens and a two-color sCMOS camera, capable of reaching 18.7 mag with 10-s exposure. Field of view is only about 25% of visible lunar surface <br> + Demonstration work showing detection of lunar impact down to R=12 (integration time about 20 ms). Compared to the work of [Madiedo et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03193) who detected +7 mag flash and calculated that it was caused by a 3 kg meteoroid, a +12 mag flash should be caused by sub-kg meteoroid <br> + Detection rate is 1e-7 per km^2 per hr. The entire visible lunar surface is 2e7 km^2. So that means a detection rate of a few per hour
| 2018-09-11 | [A Novel Entry, Descent and Landing Architecture for Mars Landers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00062) | + Proposed a table-like lander with legs equipped with strong impact absorber
| 2018-09-11 | [A fast algorithm for the detection of faint orbital debris tracks in optical images](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00239) | + Another Radon transform code to find long streaks, with C code supplied
| 2018-09-13 | [Hubble Space Telescope Observations of 3200 Phaethon At Closest Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04713) | + Searched for 10-m-sized moonlets and dust trails near Phaethon, no detection <br> + Estimation of the lifetime of deep-burying ice on Phaethon, found that ice could survive for 26 Myr if the diffusivities is regolith-like, but it is too low to explain the property of the Geminid meteoroid
| 2018-09-13 | [Development of the Arizona Robotic Telescope Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01180) | Plan to automate a number of telescopes in Arizona, now starting with the 61" Kuiper telescope and the Vatican 1.8-m; using RTS2 and astropy's ccdproc
