| 2018-06-17 | [ Long-Term Monitoring of Throughput in Las Cumbres Observatory's Fleet of Telescopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12220) | + System degration (investigated here is coating degration and dirts on mirror) causes a decrease in sensitivity of 0.3-0.5 mag per year; reservicing the mirror sees an improve of 1-2 mag
| 2018-06-17 | [Kozai-Lidov Resonant Behavior among Atira-class Asteroids](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00442) | + Atiras show Lidov-Kozai resonance in their dynamical evolution; timescales ~100 kyr
| 2018-06-17 | [Finding flares in Kepler data using machine learning tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00334) | + [AstroML](http://www.astroml.org/) <br> + Introduced machine learning method is the RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) -- an algorithm can give robust fit to periodical signals with a few outliers. Python module available in sklearn <br> + The described method is most useful for regular periodical signals such as variable stars or exoplanetary transits  + Can this be used to find comet outbursts? Not directly as cometary light-curves are complicated
| 2018-06-17 | [MULTIGRAIN: Simulating mixtures of multiple dust grains and gas with SPH](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00037) | + A module in the [PHANTOM](https://phantomsph.bitbucket.io) package which is used for hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical simulations, see also cool [visualization](http://users.monash.edu.au/~dprice/splash/) <br> + Applicable to micron to mm regime
| 2018-06-17 | [Lecture-Tutorials in Introductory Astronomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00452) | + Introduced the Lecture-Tutorial activity and suggested that this can engaged the students in Astro 101 level courses <br> + Lecture-tutorial is in form of a 2 to 7 page worksheet that addresses a single topic at a level appropriate for Astro 101" and requires the students to work together <br> + [Lecture-Tutorial materials hosted on JPL's Astro 101 site](https://astronomy101.jpl.nasa.gov/materials/) including [Think-Pair-Share Guide](https://astronomy101.jpl.nasa.gov/download/workshopfiles/Think-Pair-ShareHow-ToGuide.pdf) <br> + Figure 1 showed an example of understanding the Doppler shift of distant stars caused by their planets, a suitable problem for Lecture-Tutorial activity
| 2018-06-18 | [Search for Dust Emission from (24) Themis Using the Gemini-North Telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01461) | + Attempted to detect dust emissions by deep exposure (1 hr) on Gemini and placed the target in CCD chip gaps, capable to reach 29.7 mag/arcsec^2 <br> + For micron-sized dust on Themis, escape speed (due to typical sublimation) is too high, so might not see anything; but can be useful for the detection of dust emission due to collisions
