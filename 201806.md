| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 2018-06-17 | [ Long-Term Monitoring of Throughput in Las Cumbres Observatory's Fleet of Telescopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12220) | + System degration (investigated here is coating degration and dirts on mirror) causes a decrease in sensitivity of 0.3-0.5 mag per year; reservicing the mirror sees an improve of 1-2 mag
| 2018-06-17 | [Kozai-Lidov Resonant Behavior among Atira-class Asteroids](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00442) | + Atiras show Lidov-Kozai resonance in their dynamical evolution; timescales ~100 kyr
| 2018-06-17 | [Finding flares in Kepler data using machine learning tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00334) | + [AstroML](http://www.astroml.org/) <br> + Introduced machine learning method is the RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) -- an algorithm can give robust fit to periodical signals with a few outliers. Python module available in sklearn <br> + The described method is most useful for regular periodical signals such as variable stars or exoplanetary transits  + Can this be used to find comet outbursts? Not directly as cometary light-curves are complicated
| 2018-06-17 | [MULTIGRAIN: Simulating mixtures of multiple dust grains and gas with SPH](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00037) | + A module in the [PHANTOM](https://phantomsph.bitbucket.io) package which is used for hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical simulations, see also cool [visualization](http://users.monash.edu.au/~dprice/splash/) <br> + Applicable to micron to mm regime
| 2018-06-17 | [Lecture-Tutorials in Introductory Astronomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00452) | + Introduced the Lecture-Tutorial activity and suggested that this can engaged the students in Astro 101 level courses <br> + Lecture-tutorial is in form of a 2 to 7 page worksheet that addresses a single topic at a level appropriate for Astro 101" and requires the students to work together <br> + [Lecture-Tutorial materials hosted on JPL's Astro 101 site](https://astronomy101.jpl.nasa.gov/materials/) including [Think-Pair-Share Guide](https://astronomy101.jpl.nasa.gov/download/workshopfiles/Think-Pair-ShareHow-ToGuide.pdf) <br> + Figure 1 showed an example of understanding the Doppler shift of distant stars caused by their planets, a suitable problem for Lecture-Tutorial activity
| 2018-06-18 | [Search for Dust Emission from (24) Themis Using the Gemini-North Telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01461) | + Attempted to detect dust emissions by deep exposure (1 hr) on Gemini and placed the target in CCD chip gaps, capable to reach 29.7 mag/arcsec^2 <br> + For micron-sized dust on Themis, escape speed (due to typical sublimation) is too high, so might not see anything; but can be useful for the detection of dust emission due to collisions
| 2018-06-18 | [On the Pre-impact Orbital Evolution of 2018 LA, Parent Body of the Bright Fireball Observed over Botswana on 2018 June 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05164) | + Found a couple NEAs with D-criterion smaller than 0.05; integrated them backward and forward for 50 kyr. No conclusion reached in this Note
| 2018-06-18 | [The phase-polarization curve of asteroid (3200) Phaethon](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05277) | + Presented polarization observation of Phaethon covering phase angles from 36 to 116 deg, showed that Phaethon is more similar to asteroidal bodies like Pallas <br> + However low phase angle observation is more effective for asteroid-comet diagnostic, which the authors were't able to obtain, so question mark remains
| 2018-06-23 | [Exocomet Orbit Fitting: Accelerating Coma Absorption During Transits of Î² Pictoris](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01284) | + Presented a method that use the shift of the absorption features caused by exocomets to constrain the orbit of these comets <br> + Used are K and H lines (3934 and 3968 A), acceleration of the lines are in the order of a couple km/s and requires high resolution spectrum (R~10^5) <br> + Strong degeneracies between fitted parameters are seen when <em>e</em> is not fixed (I think "degeneracy" means parameters have same/similar effects on the outcome, see [a similar concept in cosmology](http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/intermediate/degen2.html)), so author used MCMC to explore the parameter space <br> + Just to ensure my understanding of "degeneracy" is right, the result does show that the fitted parameters are strongly correlated <br> + Investigated comets are star-gazing comets, with pericenter distance around 5-10 stellar radii
| 2018-06-23 | [Optical turbulence profiling with Stereo-SCIDAR for VLT and ELT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02585) | + Deployed Stereo-SCIDAR at VLT/ELT site region to measure optical turbulence <br> + Stereo-SCIDAR measures optical turbulence profiling but observing two stars concurrently from two sites, and then uses triangulation to figure out the height of the turbulent layer <br> + Compared Stereo-SCIDAR with DIMM/MASS and found high correlation
