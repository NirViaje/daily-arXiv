| 2018-07-02 | [TESS as a Low Surface Brightness Observatory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04485) | + For Low Surface Brightness (LSB) objects one needs fast optics and clean PSF (Eq. 1), TESS is as good as Dragonfly-I <br> + 1-month and 1-year stack of TESS data will reach 33 and 34 mag/arcsec^2 (close to 2 mag more for Dragonfly-II)
| 2018-07-02 | [Two Hyperbolic Baldheads in the Solar System: 2017 U7 and 2018 C2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06904) | + Colors and morphology of 2018 C2 indicative of cometary nature <br> + 2018 C2 was about 2 au from the Sun and was weakly active at the time of observation (<~1 kg/s mass loss rate, 1e-5 to 1e-4 active fraction) <br> + Both comets seem to be dynamically old
| 2018-07-02 | [ The impact of ELT distortions and instabilities on future astrometric observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01327) | + Distortion of the ELT mirror due to gravity flexture and wind will cause up to 5 mas error <br> + With multi-conjugate adaptive optics (MCAO; [correction in 3 dimensions using multiple deformable mirror](http://www.ctio.noao.edu/~atokovin/tutorial/part5/mcao.html)) will bring this down to <50 uas
| 2018-07-03 | [Scattering of exocomets by a planet chain: exozodi levels and the delivery of cometary material to inner planets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01289) | + Studied the inward scattering of comets in an arbitrary planetary system (focused here are late-types, K- and M-type stars) using N-body simulations, as well as the implication for observational detection and accretion of cometary materials <br> + Systems with tightly packed low-mass planets are most efficient (7%) in delivering comets into the inner region (<0.5 au), but even for inefficient systems the number is 1%, so there isn't large variation, which also explain why exozodi (zodiac disk in exoplanetary systems) seems to be common. Can't find the equivalent number for Solar System, but Levison & Duncan (1994) found that 6% Kuiper-belt comets become sungrazing comets, so the number for Solar System is probably in the ballpark <br> + JWST and future infrared space telescopes will be able to detect thermal emissions (20-50 um) from exozodi within ~20-100 au <br> + Volatile delivery is common between different architectures, with delivery rate to each inner planet to be 0.1-1%; that is, only 1 Earth mass of cometary material is needed in order to create the mass in Earth's ocean in every inner planet. Systems with chains of low-mass planet will be most efficient in doing this

Wilson, the plan is to do milliarcsecond-level imaging in J and H band <br> + The goal is to do protoplanetary disk imaging, astrometry for exoplanets, interferometric-assisted polarimitry and spectroscopy
| 2018-07-19 | [MagAO-X: project status and first laboratory results](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04315) | + A new visible AO on Magellan; most AO works in IR due to challenges of working at shorter wavelengths + Main goals: low mass stars and young giants, and protoplanets; will also do a few other cases including resolving observations of main-belt asteroids (resolution of 20-30 km at main-belt distance)
