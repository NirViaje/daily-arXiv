| 2018-07-02 | [SPECULOOS: a network of robotic telescopes to hunt for terrestrial planets around the nearest ultracool dwarfs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11205) | + An array of 1-m and 60-cm telescopes located in Paranal, Canary Islands and San Pedro Martir to search for terrestrial planets around ultracool dwarfs/UCDs (M7 or later type; like TRAPPIST-1); detection limit to K~11.5 with a sensitivity at an order of 0.1%  <br> + Orbital period of these planets in UCD systems is less than ~9.5 hours, events last ~20 min or so <br> + Corner plot is good for matrices of scatter plots and can be done with [corner.py](https://corner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
| 2018-07-02 | [TESS as a Low Surface Brightness Observatory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04485) | + For Low Surface Brightness (LSB) objects one needs fast optics and clean PSF (Eq. 1), TESS is as good as Dragonfly-I <br> + 1-month and 1-year stack of TESS data will reach 33 and 34 mag/arcsec^2 (close to 2 mag more for Dragonfly-II)
| 2018-07-02 | [Two Hyperbolic Baldheads in the Solar System: 2017 U7 and 2018 C2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06904) | + Colors and morphology of 2018 C2 indicative of cometary nature <br> + 2018 C2 was about 2 au from the Sun and was weakly active at the time of observation (<~1 kg/s mass loss rate, 1e-5 to 1e-4 active fraction) <br> + Both comets seem to be dynamically old
| 2018-07-02 | [ The impact of ELT distortions and instabilities on future astrometric observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01327) | + Distortion of the ELT mirror due to gravity flexture and wind will cause up to 5 mas error <br> + With multi-conjugate adaptive optics (MCAO; [correction in 3 dimensions using multiple deformable mirror](http://www.ctio.noao.edu/~atokovin/tutorial/part5/mcao.html)) will bring this down to <50 uas
| 2018-07-03 | [Scattering of exocomets by a planet chain: exozodi levels and the delivery of cometary material to inner planets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01289) | + Studied the inward scattering of comets in an arbitrary planetary system (focused here are late-types, K- and M-type stars) using N-body simulations, as well as the implication for observational detection and accretion of cometary materials <br> + Systems with tightly packed low-mass planets are most efficient (7%) in delivering comets into the inner region (<0.5 au), but even for inefficient systems the number is 1%, so there isn't large variation, which also explain why exozodi (zodiac disk in exoplanetary systems) seems to be common. Can't find the equivalent number for Solar System, but Levison & Duncan (1994) found that 6% Kuiper-belt comets become sungrazing comets, so the number for Solar System is probably in the ballpark <br> + JWST and future infrared space telescopes will be able to detect thermal emissions (20-50 um) from exozodi within ~20-100 au <br> + Volatile delivery is common between different architectures, with delivery rate to each inner planet to be 0.1-1%; that is, only 1 Earth mass of cometary material is needed in order to create the mass in Earth's ocean in every inner planet. Systems with chains of low-mass planet will be most efficient in doing this
| 2018-07-03 | [The Robo-AO-2 facility for rapid visible/near-infrared AO imaging and the demonstration of hybrid techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01957) | + Based on the heritage of Robo-AO and will be deployed to UH 2.2-m in around 2019, will work in g' to H with resolution comparable to Hubble <br> + Made use of UV laser guide star focused at 10 km and a deformable mirror at the telescope pupil inside the instrument box
| 2018-07-03 | [Locating Planets in Sky Using Manual Calculations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01649) | + Some hands-on calculation suitable for high school students with a priori knowledge of the orbit of planets and initial state
| 2018-07-03 | [A High-performance Atmospheric Radiation Package: with applications to the radiative energy budgets of giant planets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02573) | + New, open-source model for investigating radiative process in gas planets: [source code](https://github.com/luminoctum/athena-harp) <br> + Uranus is quite different from the other three solar system giants probably because low CH4 content
