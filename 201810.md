| 2018-10-01 | [Compositional Diversity Among Primitive Asteroids](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01148) | + Clear diversity from UV to mid-IR among primitive asteroids: a 200 nm feature associated with graphite grains, a 430 nm feature with ferric iron, a 700 nm feature for hydration but less definitive comparing to the 3 um feature, either blue-ish or reddish broad slope from 0.8 to 2.5 um, and a lot of emission features from 5 to 40 um due to silicates <br> + Two prominent groups among inner-belt primitives: Erigone-like (hydrated, spectrally diverse) and Polana-like (no 0.7 um feature, spectrally alike); Bennu and Ryugu are compatible with Polana-group

| 2018-10-07 | [The Origins Space Telescope (OST) Mission Concept Study Interim Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09702) | + (181-page report; only looked at the beginning) <br> + A 9.1-m IR telescope working at 5 to 660 um, filling in the gap between JWST and ALMA <br> + Targeting molecular features like O3, CH4, H2O, CO2 which are biosignature/bioindicative
| 2018-10-18 | [Galaxy detection and identification using deep learning and data augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01691) | + Used a range of techniques including [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/), a single-pass detector that was originally designed to detection objects in RGB images
| 2018-10-18 | [Exploring the Kuiper Belt with Sun-diving Solar Sails](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00407) | + Proposed to launch solar-sail-driven small spacecrafts from 0.1-0.3 au and achieved very high speed (20 au/year), enable fast and low cost exploration of Kuiper belt region <br> + Some modest derivation of speed, etc, suitable for math exercises
| 2018-10-19 | [Deep Learning Based Detection of Cosmological Diffuse Radio Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03315) | + A CNN-based implementation (to be precise, TensorFlow) for detection of diffuse sources; trained using synthetic sources <br> + Compared the results to that of [PyBDSF](http://www.astron.nl/citt/pybdsf/) -- used by LOFAR to decompose (radio interferometry) images to a number of Gaussian functions -- and found that they are largely in par, but each with own advantages
| 2018-10-19 | [The 2016 Reactivations of Main-Belt Comets 238P/Read and 288P/(300163) 2006 VW139](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10309) | + Observation and modeling of the reactivations of 238P and 288P in 2016 -- title said it all <br> + Dust production rates: 0.7 +/- 0.3 kg/s for 233P, 5.6 +/- 0.7 kg/s for 288P <br> + Compared observation to positive archival detection of activity in 2000, showed similar active position <br> + More dust modeling is needed for more insight
| 2018-10-19 | [Models of Rosetta/OSIRIS 67P dust coma phase function](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10424) | + Phase function of dust from 67P from 0 to 160 deg using observation from Rosetta/OSIRIS <br> + Tested particles of different shape and orientation (not just spherical particles) and found that only elongated >10 um particles with long axis penperdicular to the direction of solar radiation can match the observations; randomly oriented particles do not work <br> + Porosity of 60-70%
| 2018-10-19 | [OSSOS: XV. No active Centaurs in the Outer Solar System Origins Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03648) | + Examined about 20 Centaurs in the OSSOS data (compared to about 250 known Centaurs in total) to search for cometary activities using PSF method <br> + No active Centaurs found (but did not seems to explicitly give constraints for dust production rate)
| 2018-10-29 | [From FATS to feets: Further improvements to an astronomical feature extraction tool based on machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02154) | + A software document on FATS and feets, with the latter a cleared-up (in terms of code structure) version of the former. FATS/feets allows the users to use some pre-defined features to mine a light-curve dataset in a machine-learning fashion
| 2018-10-29 | [Computational astrophysics for the future: An open, modular approach with agreed standards would facilitate astrophysical discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02600) | + Argued that computer programs in astrophysics are opaque and incomprehendable to outsiders and therefore need to be modernized. This is needed as scientific discoveries need to be testable, verifiable and quantifiable by everybody
| 2018-10-29 | [The Leaky Pipeline for Postdocs: A study of the time between receiving a PhD and securing a faculty job for male and female astronomers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01511) | + Both male and female astronomers who landed TT jobs spent 4-5+-0.4 years between PhD and TT position, but females are 3-4x more likely to leave academia before landing their TT positions
| 2018-10-29 | [Rotationally-Resolved Spectroscopic Characterization of near-Earth object (3200) Phaethon](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11157) | + Rotational-resolved spectra of Phaethon covering the entire rotation, shows bluish surface with little variation, and relatively low albedo (pv=0.08+-0.01) which is a bit lower than previous measurements <br> + The new derived albedo is much lower than Pallas (pv=0.12-0.16) and seems to imply that the two may not be linked <br> + Bluish surface and dynamical origin of Phaethon is similar to 249P/LINEAR (near-Earth comet), the two could have some sort of commonality and should therefore receive more attention
| 2018-10-30 | [Have we missed an interstellar comet four years ago?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12766) | + C/2014 W10 might be an interstellar comet, but solution with e>1 is below 2 sigma <br> + Future high e objects deserve more astrometric observations
| 2018-10-30 | [Could Solar Radiation Pressure Explain 'Oumuamua's Peculiar Acceleration?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11490) | + In absence of cometary activity, thin shet model could explain 'Oumuamua's non-gravitational acceleration; such object is hard to be produced naturally <br> + Attention needs to be paid to future objects
