| 2018-10-01 | [Compositional Diversity Among Primitive Asteroids](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01148) | + Clear diversity from UV to mid-IR among primitive asteroids: a 200 nm feature associated with graphite grains, a 430 nm feature with ferric iron, a 700 nm feature for hydration but less definitive comparing to the 3 um feature, either blue-ish or reddish broad slope from 0.8 to 2.5 um, and a lot of emission features from 5 to 40 um due to silicates <br> + Two prominent groups among inner-belt primitives: Erigone-like (hydrated, spectrally diverse) and Polana-like (no 0.7 um feature, spectrally alike); Bennu and Ryugu are compatible with Polana-group
| 2018-10-06 | [The LUVOIR Mission Concept Study Interim Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09668) | + 441-page report, just look over \S1 <br> + LUVOIR is a scalable design of next-generation space telescope successing HST; a 8 or 15-m telescope at L2, covering 100 nm to 2.5 micron <br> + Excellent Figure 1 showing the power of LUVOIR in the field of exoplanets, galaxies, and solar system
| 2018-10-07 | [The Origins Space Telescope (OST) Mission Concept Study Interim Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09702) | + (181-page report; only looked at the beginning) <br> + A 9.1-m IR telescope working at 5 to 660 um, filling in the gap between JWST and ALMA <br> + Targeting molecular features like O3, CH4, H2O, CO2 which are biosignature/bioindicative
