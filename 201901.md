| 2019-01-03 | [174P/Echeclus and its Blue Coma Observed Post-Outburst](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11220) | + Presented visible-NIR spectrum of Centaur 174P/Echeclus before and after its outburst <br> + Found a blue-ish spectrum up to 1.3 micron (-8% per 100 nm), compared with laboratory experiments on meteorites and suggested that this is due to carbon-rich material in the ejected dust <br> + Also suggested that the blue-ish material neutralized the tholin on the surface of the Centaur, giving it a neutral color
| 2019-01-08 | [The Discus Comet: C/2014 B1 (Schwartz)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01438) | + Debunked the idea that the discus-like appearance of C/2014 B1 is due to Lorentz force; suggests that this can be explained by ejection from the "equator" of the nucleus mostly driven by centripital force <br> + Also suggests that this is only recently discovered as such ejection is brief and will be replaced by semi-isotropic ejection once the comet reach certain distance (about 10 au)
| 2019-01-08 | [Discovery statistics and the 1/a-distribution of long-period comets detected over the 1801-2017 period](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01722) | + Searched for some statistical signatures by examining all (hundreds of) long-period comets (LPCs) discovered after 1801 <br> + Showed that Oort-spike comets (with <em>a</em> near 10,000 au) are more easily detected than typical LPCs (anything with <em>a</em>>34 au), confirming that LPCs may be subjected to fading
| 2019-01-08 | [Waiting to make an impact: a probable excess of near-Earth asteroids in 2018 LA-like orbits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11845) | + Reports a "significant" excess of objects on 2018 LA-like orbits based on Monte Carlo model
| 2019-01-08 | [Crater Density Predictions for New Horizons flyby target 2014 MU69](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09785) | + Use crater distribution on Pluto-Charon system to predict the crater density on 2014 MU69; predicts sparse crater density with most are below 1 km
| 2019-01-09 | [Fast algorithms for slow moving asteroids: constraints on the distribution of Kuiper Belt Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02492) | + A likelihood-based search of point sources in a series of images, a bit similar to synthetic tracking but seems to be less resource hunger than the latter <br> + Tested on HiTS data (limiting magnitude 23.1) and did boost the limiting magnitude to 24 with 12-15 images <br> + [Codes public on GitHub](https://github.com/dirac-institute/kbmod)
| 2019-01-14 | [Probabilistic Random Forest: A machine learning algorithm for noisy datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05994) | + Presents a modification of the RF model -- all labels and features are now probabilistic distributions rather than deterministic distributions <br> + [Python implementation](https://github.com/ireis/PRF) <br> + Tests with sample noisy datasets show that it outperforms the RF model, and can be used for Transfer Learning
| 2019-01-14 | [The dynamical evolution of escaped Jupiter Trojan asteroids, link to other minor body populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00352) | + Previous works suggested that Jupiter Trojans are dynamically stable within 10-100 Myr, this work investigates what happens after that <br> + Small difference between L5 and L4 population -- particles in L5 is slightly more prone to escape <br> + Mean dynamical lifetime of escapees is 250 kyr; since the formation of the Solar System, about 25% Trojans have escaped <br> + Almost all ended up in cometary orbit; rate of escape of 1-km diameter Trojans is about 30 per Myr <br> + Mentioned, seems to implied (but did not elaborated) that stable, rocky JFCs in the NEO region could be from escaped Trojans
| 2019-01-14 | [A new generalized differential image motion monitor](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07561) | + Presents a new instrument, the generalized DIMM, similar to DIMM but is more portable and easier to set up (?) <br> + Shows a prototype with a C11 and a 100 fps camera
| 2019-01-14 | [VOEvent for Solar and Planetary Sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12680) | + Proposes format of modified VOEvent to enable reporting solar wind events and meteor showers/outbursts
| 2019-01-14 | [NEARBY Platform for Detecting Asteroids in Astronomical Images Using Cloud-based Containerized Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04248) | + An asteroid detection pipeline that uses redis, mysql as back-end, and HTML5, Python and flask as front-end

| 2019-01-16 | [Machine-learning Approaches to Exoplanet Transit Detection and Candidate Validation in Wide-field Ground-based Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07754) | + Tested a couple ML algorithm to the WASP data to find transit signals <br> + Tested several machine-learning techniques provided by sci-kit-learn, including random forest; also built and tested a neural network based on Keras <br> + Reached a gross accuracy of 90%, but each algorithm has pros and cons
| 2019-01-16 | [A-PHOT: a new, versatile code for precision aperture photometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00727) | + [A-Phot](http://www.astrodeep.eu/a-phot/) is good for photometries involving a series of data with blended galaxies and stars -- it reads references from a pre-defined list and can determine basic shapes of the target
| 2019-01-16 | [Ecology of Near-Earth Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10478) | + Discussed the pollution by man-made objects/sources in the Earth orbit -- can be classified into mechanical, chemical, radioactive and electromagnetic pollution <br> + In-space collision after 100 years will be about 10 times as bad
| 2019-01-17 | [Rubble Pile Asteroids](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01815) | <strong>+ Rubble-pile structure of asteroids can be inferred from several fronts: dynamical/mechanical (violent collisions in the asteroid belt in the past, sufficient to produce numerous small fragments that can stick together at a later stage by gravitational attractions), and observational (spin barrier observed from light-curve observations; in-situ observations of asteroids) <br> + Some evidence suggested that asteroids were "born big" -- the first-generation asteroids are about 100 km in sizes, but exact process remains an open question; c.f. [Johansen et al. (2015, Asteroids IV)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015aste.book..471J) <br> + Tidal disruption (e.g. SL9) and YORP spin-ups can reshape rubble piles <br> + Can tidal effect also plays a role in the catastrophic disruption of (near-Earth) asteroids? Not sure, because dynamical lifetime of NEAs is already quite short </strong> 
| 2019-01-17 | [A power law decay evolution scenario for polluted single white dwarfs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08317) | + Attempts to explain the small fraction (1-4%) of dusty and/or metal-polluted white dwarfs <br> + Shows that a gas giant in a WD system with a sizable asteroid belt can drive asteroids into the Roche limit of the white dwarf, which will then pollute the WD <br> + The gradual dissipation of the remnant dust (which falls into the WD due to Poynting-Robert drag) will "restore" the WD, making it appeared as unpolluted/undusty; thus older WD will show less mass accretion rate; simulation shows that a turning point of the power-law (mass accretion rate vs cooling age) exists at around 1 Gyr, which is consistent with observations
