| 2019-01-03 | [174P/Echeclus and its Blue Coma Observed Post-Outburst](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11220) | + Presented visible-NIR spectrum of Centaur 174P/Echeclus before and after its outburst <br> + Found a blue-ish spectrum up to 1.3 micron (-8% per 100 nm), compared with laboratory experiments on meteorites and suggested that this is due to carbon-rich material in the ejected dust <br> + Also suggested that the blue-ish material neutralized the tholin on the surface of the Centaur, giving it a neutral color
