| 2019-02-05 | [Exocomets in the 47 UMa System: Theoretical Simulations including Water Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09579) | + Studied the dynamics of comets in the 47 UMa system to place context for the observations; studied the content accumulated on a pseudo-Earth in that system under different dynamical configurations <br> + 47 UMa system has three Jupiter-class planets <br> + The pseudo-Earth in the 47 UMa system receives much less cometary water comparing to the Earth <br> + Searched for comet families but found none; however, found population analogous to Jupiter-family comets <br> + Key idea is to search for Solar System equivalent structures in 47 UMa system
| 2019-02-05 | [Galactic astronomy and small telescopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06461) | + Small telescopes (though didn't quite mention how small they are -- seems like still in the meter-range) with customized filter sets have great prospect in galactic archaeology
| 2019-02-05 | [An On-Orbit CubeSat Centrifuge for Asteroid Science and Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11663) | + Described an on-orbit device rotating at about 1-2 RPM to simulate the low-gravitiy environment on asteroids (and comets too) for experiments <br> + Could study regolith strength, granular force between particles, and dust-jet interactions (which is also applicable to comets)
| 2019-02-05 | [Arecibo Radar Observations of Near-Earth Asteroid (3200) Phaethon During the 2017 Apparition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00969) | + Arecibo S-band image of Phaethon, resolution 75 m/pixel <br> + No satellites, no coma <br> + Identified a large crater (1-km-class) in the low-latitude area, and a "radar-dark" region at one of the poles <br> + Seems to have an equtorial ridge similar to Bennu and Ryugu
| 2019-02-14 | [ALMA Autocorrelation Spectroscopy of Comets: The HCN/H^13CN ratio in C/2012 S1 (ISON)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08676) | + The spatial resolution of ALMA is too high to observe large-scale coma structures <br> + Presented "autocorrelation" technique which simultaneously collect data using ALMA's interferometric dishes (i.e. act like a single-dish telescope) and applied it to observe C/ISON
| 2019-02-14 | [A Single Physical Model for Diverse Meteoroid Data Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02977) | + Despite the name, this is a dynamical model for interplanetary spacecrafts <br> + Largely based on infrared data of the zodiacal cloud; somehow conflicts with AMOR data due to conflicts between AMOR data and IR data of the zodiacal cloud
| 2019-02-14 | [Guidance, Navigation and Control of Asteroid Mobile Imager and Geologic Observer (AMIGO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02071) | + A 1U-sized expandable cubesat that to be deployed near a km-sized asteroid and conduct in-situ investigation through hopping <br> + Consists of stereo camera, electric field sensor, laser reflector and solar panel

| 2019-02-14 | [The Maribo CM2 meteorite fall - survival of weak material at high entry speed](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01112) | + The Maribo meteorite (fall in Denmark in 2009) shows that weak material (<2.5 gcc) with high entry speed (28 km/s) is possible to survive the fall, but only small fragments will remain (>99% of mass was evaporated in the atmosphere)
| 2019-02-20 | [The Little Dippers: Transits of Star-grazing Exocomets?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12414) | + Presented two systems exhibiting shallower transit features (dip at 0.5% level) that last about 0.5-1 day <br> + Cannot be transiting young planets because there is no infrared excess of the system <br> <strong>+ Proposed that these are 10-km-sized star-grazing exocomets, and suggested that these hinted giant planets in the vicinity</strong>
| 2019-02-20 | [Pan-STARRS PSF-Matching for Subtraction and Stacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09999) | + PSF construction for star subtraction for the Pan-STARRS 1 survey
| 2019-02-20 | [Project Lyra: Catching 1I/'Oumuamua - Mission Opportunities After 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04935) | + It is possible to launch a probe around the 2030s and reach 'Oumuamua in about 2050, with current and "near-term" technology <br> + Orbital calculation: [Optimum Interplanetary Trajectory](https://github.com/AdamHibberd/Optimum_Interplanetary_Trajectory)
| 2019-02-20 | [Properties of meteors with double peaked light curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05931) | + Two types of double-peaked meteoroids: suddened peaked with fragmentation -- asteroidal; smooth peaked with almost no fragmentation -- cometary <br> + Failed to produce the double peak using a single body model with different chemical composition -- means that good ablation models must include fragmentation
| 2019-02-21 | [Scattered moonlight observations with X-Shooter: Implications for the aerosol properties at Cerro Paranal and the ESO sky background model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04637) | + Taking spectra of background sky at different distances to the moon, in order to test the assumed aerosal properties in the older model <br> + The old model does not produce the shape of the size distribution well <br> + New method gives way to probe the aerosol size distribution
| 2019-02-21 | [An Autonomous Passive Navigation Method for Nanosatellite Exploration of the Asteroid Belt](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03180) | + A new navigation technique: using nearby asteroids to figure out the position of the satellite, with no a priori knowledge of the precise ephemerides of either the asteroid or the satellite <br> + Looks like this is to teach the satellite to construct an ephemerides database by its own <br> + Useful for nanosats exploring small asteroids far from the Earth (and therefore, are hard to be measured from the Earth before hand)
