| 2019-02-05 | [Exocomets in the 47 UMa System: Theoretical Simulations including Water Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09579) | + Studied the dynamics of comets in the 47 UMa system to place context for the observations; studied the content accumulated on a pseudo-Earth in that system under different dynamical configurations <br> + 47 UMa system has three Jupiter-class planets <br> + The pseudo-Earth in the 47 UMa system receives much less cometary water comparing to the Earth <br> + Searched for comet families but found none; however, found population analogous to Jupiter-family comets <br> + Key idea is to search for Solar System equivalent structures in 47 UMa system
| 2019-02-05 | [Galactic astronomy and small telescopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06461) | + Small telescopes (though didn't quite mention how small they are -- seems like still in the meter-range) with customized filter sets have great prospect in galactic archaeology
| 2019-02-05 | [An On-Orbit CubeSat Centrifuge for Asteroid Science and Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11663) | + Described an on-orbit device rotating at about 1-2 RPM to simulate the low-gravitiy environment on asteroids (and comets too) for experiments <br> + Could study regolith strength, granular force between particles, and dust-jet interactions (which is also applicable to comets)
| 2019-02-05 | [Arecibo Radar Observations of Near-Earth Asteroid (3200) Phaethon During the 2017 Apparition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00969) | + Arecibo S-band image of Phaethon, resolution 75 m/pixel <br> + No satellites, no coma <br> + Identified a large crater (1-km-class) in the low-latitude area, and a "radar-dark" region at one of the poles <br> + Seems to have an equtorial ridge similar to Bennu and Ryugu
