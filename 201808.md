| 2018-08-01 | [The Inner Solar System's Habitability Through Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04776) | + Habitability of Earth, Venus, Mars does not evolve in a constant rate; with only 3 samples the repository of well-understood habitable planets is very undersampled, global climate models show that habitability varies greatly with slightly varied contents of greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4) <br> + The fact that lifes on Earth endure many and persistented ice ages show that life may not require the host planet to have sustainable surface liquid water, icy bodies in and out of solar system could be inhabited
| 2018-08-01 | [How dark can it get at night? Examining how clouds darken the sky via all-sky differential photometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10593) | + Surface illuminance on cloudy nights is "a major knowledge gap" and is very valuable for ecological modeling and research on artificial light pollution <br> + Analyzed all-sky images taken under clear and cloudy nights and studied the difference, derived illuminance level under cloudy nights <br> + Dark sites can be strongly affected by local artificial light under cloudy nights; sky spectrum shifts to the red on cloud nights
| 2018-08-01 | [Detecting solar system objects with convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10912) | + Detect simulated asteroidal trails (comets not considered) using CNNs in simulated Euclid data <br> + Using Tensorflow but adopt 3 different model architectures <br> + Used transfer learning to speed up training; transfer learning uses already-trained architecture and tune it to new labels <br> + Missed more than half of slow movers (~10"/hr, but looks reasonably long on the stamps) but seems to be very good for long ones, 1% false positive rate reaches 80-90% true positive rate
| 2018-08-01 | [Coma Morphology, Numerical Modeling, and Production Rates for Comet C/Lulin (2007 N3)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11867) | + Found a 97 deg obliquity for C/Lulin, slow rotator (41 hr period), small active fraction (4-5%) and a possibly large nucleus (8 km) <br> + Argued that C/Lulin behaves more like a long-period comet rather than a dynamically new comet based on its small active fraction and dominance of large dust grains (from other studies)
| 2018-08-01 | [Rotational variation of the linear polarisation of the asteroid (3200) Phaethon as evidence for inhomogeneity in its surface properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11842) | + Confirmed the spectrum type (B/F) and the rotation period (3.6 hr) of Phaethon <br> + Distinct variation of polarisation as Phaethon rotates. Since Arecibo shows no large terrain changes across Phaethon, only change in regolith property can explain the observed feature
| 2018-08-02 | [The Contribution of Dwarf Planets to the Origin of Low Inclination Comets by the Replenishment of Mean Motion Resonances in Debris Disks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06783) | + In a configuration of one giant interior planet (like Jupiter) and a number of dwarf planets in an exterior belt (like a heavier Kuiper belt), secular resonances could form and could be resposible of delivering more comets to the inner part of the planetary system <br> + A Kuiper belt with 0.25 M_Earth could deliver 0.6 new comet per year into the inner solar system; currently the mass of the Kuiper belt is 0.04-0.1 M_Earth, but in early solar system the mass could be around 30 M_Earth <br> + Implication for habitability for rocky planets in such planetary system
| 2018-08-02 | [Chromatic transit light curves of disintegrating rocky planets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07973) | + Case study of Kepler-1520, used dynamical simulation and the [MCMax3D](http://www.michielmin.nl/codes/mcmax3D/) (a Monto Carlo radiation transfer code) to investigate wavelength dependency of transits <br> + Found no wavelength dependency for optically thick trails, which explains why some transits show wavelength dependency while some don't <br> + Derived very high mass lost rate for Kepler-1520 (7-80 M_Earth/Gyr) which does not agree with observed sample, so mass lost rate may be very variable, with a chance of being of volcanic origin; dynamical constraint shows particles must be <50 micron in diameter though also depends on the ejection angle (cone ejection or spherically symmetric meta-particle ejection) <br> + Derived an ejection speed of 1.2 km/s for Kepler-1520 based on transit depth
| 2018-08-02 | [<strong>Dynamical Evolution of the Early Solar System</strong> (published version)](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-astro-081817-052028) | + Planetisimals dragged Neptune, Uranus outwards; a 20 M_Earth Kuiper belt would have drove Neptune from 20 au to 30 au (not clear why 20 au was chosen; probably because Saturn is at 10 au and Neptune couldn't have been much closer than 20 au) <br> + Jumping Neptune explains the heavily populated resonance points <br> + Jumping Uranus and Neptune also leads to a more circular orbit of Jupiter (<em>e</em>=0.01) whereas the current <em>e</em>=0.045, the most plausible explanation is that a third giant interacted with Jupiter and Saturn and was later ejected, leaving Jupiter in a more eccentric and inner orbit, and Saturn on an outer one <br> + One constraint used to study planetary dynamics is the angular momemtum deficit (AMD), the total angular momentum needed to keep a planet in a circular and coplanar (i.e. in the same plane) orbit; AMD is a product of orbital frequency, <em>a, e, i</em> of different planets <br> + The jumping Jupiter model also explains a stable inner system, because otherwise the inner planets will become dynamically excited in the order of 10 Myr <br> + How much a resonance is populated in the asteroid belt also serve as important sanity check for the jumping Jupiter model; the distribution of <em>a</em> suggests that the time of instable outer solar system must be short (<1 Myr) <br> + Mass of the outer disk is derived from planetary migration models and is consistent with the one derived from the current population of Jupiter Trojans; both points to 15-20 M_Earth <br> + Chaotic periods in the outer solar system also answers the long-standing question on why the <em>i</em> distribution of Jupiter Trojan is so broad (up to 40 deg), because a quiet outer solar system will lead to a much flatter distribution of the Trojans (<10 deg) <br> + Size, shape and crater distributions of the moons of the giant planets gave important clue on whether and how many close encounters a giant has had with another giant; presence and orbital distribution of Uranian and Jovian moons suggest that both planets did not have close encounter with another giant, but the similar number of irregular moons (which must have been captured during distant planetary encounters) suggest that all giants have had some distant encounters with each other <br> + Similar to the usage of the resonance of the asteroid belt, the resonance of the Kuiper belt and be used to check how long did it take for Neptune to migrate outward, and the answer is >10 Myr; also gave clue to the initial mass of the Kuiper belt which is consistent with other estimates <br> + Obliquities of giant planets provide constraints to the orbit resonance frequencies due to the (de-)coupling of spin-orbit resonance <br> + Models described above place constraints on the population of comets in the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud, and the number of large (>1 km-sized) JFCs and HTCs obtained from the model is consistent with observation <br> + Our understanding of the origin and evolution of comets is poor in part because 1-10 km sized comets in the Kuiper belt aren't observable at the moment, but this problem can be circumvented by relying on models and to try to match the observed comet population with <em>q</em><2.5 au <br> + Lifetime of comets is a critical parameter that change the outcome of the modeling, currently it is accepted that km-sized comets have a lifetime of ~500 perihelion passages; larger (>10 km) comets must be long-lived in order to match the observed population of large comets; lifetime of <1 km comets is not understood, but must be <10 perihelion passages in order to match the ratio of returning-new comets <br> + Most recent understanding of the impact flux suggests that asteroids alone cannot explain the high impact rate during the LHB, and this does not depends on time; comets must be involved and play a predominant role <br> + Some background information: (1) planets scattering planetisimals will have their orbital radii changed due to conservation of orbital momentum; planets move inward if they scatter planetisimals outward and vice versa; (2) orbital distribution of small bodies can be tied to the migration of giant planets in the past, because resonances created by the planets were different in the past, and resonances are efficient way to dynamically excite/remove small bodies by increasing their orbital eccentricity (which lead to planetary encounter); resonances also increase the orbital inclination of small bodies which leaves footprint in orbital distribution plots. As giant planet migrates, resonances sweep across inner solar system and governs the <em>a, e, i</em> distributions of small bodies in the asteroid belt <br> + By contrast, objects in some Kuiper belt resonances tend to be long-lived (e.g. Pluto) because they are phase-protected and don't have encounter with Neptune
| 2018-08-18 | [The excitation of a primordial cold asteroid belt as an outcome of the planetary instability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00609) | + Jumping Jupiter can introduce forces of changing magnitudes and phases across the main-belt region, therefore excites it; throughout the age of the Solar System this can reduce the mass of the main belt region by 90%  
| 2018-08-18 | [Yes, Aboriginal Australians Can and Did Discover the Variability of Betelgeuse](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01862) | + Based on author's experience and AAVSO records, the variability of Betelgeuse (0.0-1.3 mag) is detectable even by inexperienced observer <br> + Argued that the discovery by Aboriginal Australians has been passed down into their lore, as hinted by similar activities happened more recently (e.g. eruption of eta Carinae in the 1840s)
| 2018-08-18 | [Historical observations of STEVE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01872) | + Summary and compilation of historical observations of the STEVE phenomena in western countries, dates back to late 19th cenury and futher to 18th century (but less certain)
| 2018-08-18 | [Great Expectations: Plans and Predictions for New Horizons Encounter with Kuiper Belt Object 2014 MU69 ('Ultima Thule')](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02118) | + Summary of what we know about 2014 MU69 so far <br> + Flyby distance of 3500 km and a resolution of about 100 m/pixel <br> + Expected to detect H2O, CH4, N2, CH3OH, NH3; will study composition, surface geology, structure, near space environment (rings/moons) and search for activity
| 2018-08-18 | [<strong>The Origin of RNA Precursors on Exoplanets</strong>](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02718) | + Calculation on how to (quickly) build up RNA structures ("abiogenesis") via UV light ("light chemistry") on various star systems <br> + Also examine reaction without UV light ("dark chemistry") but it seems to be too slow <br> + SO_3^2- could produce RNA-like structure for stars hotter than K5 (4400 K) and this abiogenesis regime overlaps with liquid water zone; HS^- is too slow in all cases; but no explicit numbers are quoted (maybe I miss it?) -- SO_3^2- is 3 magnitude faster than HS^-
