| 2018-08-01 | [The Inner Solar System's Habitability Through Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04776) | + Habitability of Earth, Venus, Mars does not evolve in a constant rate; with only 3 samples the repository of well-understood habitable planets is very undersampled, global climate models show that habitability varies greatly with slightly varied contents of greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4) <br> + The fact that lifes on Earth endure many and persistented ice ages show that life may not require the host planet to have sustainable surface liquid water, icy bodies in and out of solar system could be inhabited
| 2018-08-01 | [How dark can it get at night? Examining how clouds darken the sky via all-sky differential photometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10593) | + Surface illuminance on cloudy nights is "a major knowledge gap" and is very valuable for ecological modeling and research on artificial light pollution <br> + Analyzed all-sky images taken under clear and cloudy nights and studied the difference, derived illuminance level under cloudy nights <br> + Dark sites can be strongly affected by local artificial light under cloudy nights; sky spectrum shifts to the red on cloud nights
| 2018-08-01 | [Detecting solar system objects with convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10912) | + Detect simulated asteroidal trails (comets not considered) using CNNs in simulated Euclid data <br> + Using Tensorflow but adopt 3 different model architectures <br> + Used transfer learning to speed up training; transfer learning uses already-trained architecture and tune it to new labels <br> + Missed more than half of slow movers (~10"/hr, but looks reasonably long on the stamps) but seems to be very good for long ones, 1% false positive rate reaches 80-90% true positive rate
| 2018-08-01 | [Coma Morphology, Numerical Modeling, and Production Rates for Comet C/Lulin (2007 N3)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11867) | + Found a 97 deg obliquity for C/Lulin, slow rotator (41 hr period), small active fraction (4-5%) and a possibly large nucleus (8 km) <br> + Argued that C/Lulin behaves more like a long-period comet rather than a dynamically new comet based on its small active fraction and dominance of large dust grains (from other studies)
| 2018-08-01 | [Rotational variation of the linear polarisation of the asteroid (3200) Phaethon as evidence for inhomogeneity in its surface properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11842) | + Confirmed the spectrum type (B/F) and the rotation period (3.6 hr) of Phaethon <br> + Distinct variation of polarisation as Phaethon rotates. Since Arecibo shows no large terrain changes across Phaethon, only change in regolith property can explain the observed feature
| 2018-08-02 | [The Contribution of Dwarf Planets to the Origin of Low Inclination Comets by the Replenishment of Mean Motion Resonances in Debris Disks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06783) | + In a configuration of one giant interior planet (like Jupiter) and a number of dwarf planets in an exterior belt (like a heavier Kuiper belt), secular resonances could form and could be resposible of delivering more comets to the inner part of the planetary system <br> + A Kuiper belt with 0.25 M_Earth could deliver 0.6 new comet per year into the inner solar system; currently the mass of the Kuiper belt is 0.04-0.1 M_Earth, but in early solar system the mass could be around 30 M_Earth <br> + Implication for habitability for rocky planets in such planetary system
| 2018-08-02 | [Chromatic transit light curves of disintegrating rocky planets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07973) | + Case study of Kepler-1520, used dynamical simulation and the [MCMax3D](http://www.michielmin.nl/codes/mcmax3D/) (a Monto Carlo radiation transfer code) to investigate wavelength dependency of transits <br> + Found no wavelength dependency for optically thick trails, which explains why some transits show wavelength dependency while some don't <br> + Derived very high mass lost rate for Kepler-1520 (7-80 M_Earth/Gyr) which does not agree with observed sample, so mass lost rate may be very variable, with a chance of being of volcanic origin; dynamical constraint shows particles must be <50 micron in diameter though also depends on the ejection angle (cone ejection or spherically symmetric meta-particle ejection) <br> + Derived an ejection speed of 1.2 km/s for Kepler-1520 based on transit depth
