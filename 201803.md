| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 2018-03-06 | [Lunar Crater Identification via Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02192) | + Applied Keras+TensorFlow on digital elevation data to identify craters <br> + Overfitting -- which will result good result on training data but poor result on new data -- need to be addressed carefully <br> + Has experimented the code on Mercury
| 2018-03-11 | [Delivery of organics to Mars through asteroid and comet impacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03270) | + Impacts made by known population of asteroids/comets account for 5-70% organics accretion (measured rate) on Mars <br> + Organics deposited by impacts distributed up to 150 km from the impact point
| 2018-03-11 | [Pre-MAP Search for Transiting Objects Orbiting White Dwarfs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03584) | + Use a 50 cm telescope to search for moon-sized objects (or larger) orbiting white dwarfs <br> + Transit depth by Earth-sized objects could be >50%, small telescopes could make a contribution <br> + Periods corresponding to tidal disruption around a white dwarf host is 3-10 hr
| 2018-03-12 | [Exploring Extreme Space Weather Factors of Exoplanetary Habitability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03751) | + Understanding how stellar activities (e.g. flares) affect the habitability of exoplanets is important <br> + Study of the atmospheric evolution of Mars provides context for the previous question (a.k.a. why MAVEN is important) <br> + For observers, understanding the activity of K-M stars is a useful thing to do
| 2018-03-12 | [Light scattering by fractal dust aggregates II: Opacity and asymmetry parameter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03775) | + Aim to reproduce scattering properties of dust aggregates of 0.1 to 100 microns in size <br> + In most scenarios (i.e. dust larger than incident wavelength), the few approximate methods that work well is either the Mean field theory (MFT) if not multiple scattering, or the modified MFT presented by the authors <br> + For practical use, a numerical method called the T-Matrix Method (TMM), will do
| 2018-03-12 | [Towards completing Planetary Systems: The role of minor bodies on life growth and survival](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04010) | + **Useful and important**: a lengthy discussion of how studies of small bodies are useful for the understanding of exoplanets, habitability, etc. <br> + Formation, properties and habitability of exotrojans, formation, evolution and environment of exocomets.
