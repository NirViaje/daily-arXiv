| 2018-03-12 | [Light scattering by fractal dust aggregates II: Opacity and asymmetry parameter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03775) | + Aim to reproduce scattering properties of dust aggregates of 0.1 to 100 microns in size <br> + In most scenarios (i.e. dust larger than incident wavelength), the few approximate methods that work well is either the Mean field theory (MFT) if not multiple scattering, or the modified MFT presented by the authors <br> + For practical use, a numerical method called the T-Matrix Method (TMM), will do
| 2018-03-12 | [**Towards completing Planetary Systems: The role of minor bodies on life growth and survival**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04010) | + A lengthy discussion of how studies of small bodies are useful for the understanding of exoplanets, habitability, etc. <br> + Formation, properties and habitability of exotrojans, formation, evolution and environment of exocomets
| 2018-03-12 | [Lunar Crater Identification via Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02192) | + Applied Keras+TensorFlow on digital elevation data to identify craters <br> + Overfitting -- which will result good result on training data but poor result on new data -- need to be addressed carefully <br> + Has experimented the code on Mercury
| 2018-03-13 | [Witnessing Planetary Systems in the Making with the Next Generation Very Large Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04467) | + Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will probe smaller (5-10 Earth masses) proto-planets closer (0.5 au at 140 pc) to their host stars <br> + Sensitive size range of dust is at the order of 1 mm to 1 cm
| 2018-03-13 | [Olivine-rich asteroids in the near-Earth space](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04486) | + Olivine-rich asteroids are interesting because they are formed either from magmatic differentiation (a process that happens in the crust of large proto-planets) or directly from the protoplanetary nebula <br> + The paper claimed that A-type (potentially olivine-rich) asteroids are more abundant in sub-km-sized Near-Earth Asteroids <br> + However the derived fraction is still quite low, suggesting that the number of primordial differentiated bodies is likely not too high
| 2018-03-14 | [Phoebe: a surface dominated by water](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04979) | + Used 1.5, 2 and 3 micron band images produced by Cassini and found Phoebe exhibits water absorption over its entire surface <br> + The depth of these absorption features look similar to those of dynamically excited Kuiper Belt Objects <br> + Crater size distribution of water-rich region and water-poor region differs, possibly pointing that water-rich regions were excavated later
| 2018-03-15 | [New constraints on turbulence and embedded planet mass in the HD 163296 disk from planet-disk hydrodynamic simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05437) | + Hydrodynamic modeling of the gaps in the HD 163296 system implies that the viscosity varies by a factor of 100 throughout the disk, can be explained by different physics due to planet-disk interaction
| 2018-03-18 | [Earth: Atmospheric Evolution of a Habitable Planet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05967) | + Levels of biosignature gases on the Earth varies by ~5 orders of magnitudes throughout the history of the Earth. Levels of biosignature gases on habitable planets may be different from the Earth's
| 2018-03-18 | [Thermophysical modeling of main-belt asteroids from WISE thermal data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06116) | **+ [Asteroid Absolute Magnitude and Slope database](https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/PSR/Asteroid+absolute+magnitude+and+slope)** <br> + Use varied shape thermophysical model (VS-TPM) to mine WISE data (W3, W4 band) <br> + Low thermal inertia (~10 J/m^2/s^0.5/K) -- fine grain (10-100 microns); high thermal inertia -- ~100 J/m^2/s^0.5/K (mm to cm sizes, typical on NEAs) <br> **+ Fast rotator (<4 hr) tends to have high thermal inertia, particle lost due to centrifugal force?**
| 2018-03-19 | [Hesperos: A geophysical mission to Venus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06652) | + Previous missions tell us that (a) (sub-)surface activity and atmospheric behavior of present-day Venus is dominated by volcanism, however neither the subsurface nor the atmosphere is well understood <br> + Need to understand how Venus and Earth is different even though they have similar formation environment; this will provide context for exoplanet evolution <br> + Two components: a balloon to study atmospheric composition, and an orbiter to study the interior
| 2018-03-19 | [Dynamical Evolution of Planetary Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06704) | + Ways to get a planetary system into an unstable state: spontaneous (when some planets are too close, e.g. < 10 mutual Hill sphere) or under external perturbation (e.g. gas drag, stellar companion) <br> + Observation of infant planetary system (<100 Myr after formation) will be important
| 2018-03-19 | [Accretion Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06708) | + Accretion has to be effective and fast, otherwise planets will be small, and gas giants will not be able to get enough hydrogen and helium before they are blown away by the central star <br> + Three steps in accretion: sticking of microscopic dust into larger grains and pebbles; formation of planetesimals (like asteroids and comets); collisional coagulation of planetsimals and accretion of smaller dust into planets <br> + Details of the role of accretion/migration in planetary formation can be better understood with a synergy between telescopic observation of protoplanetary disks, geochemical analyses of meteorites, in-situ exploration of solar system bodies, and theoretical modelling
