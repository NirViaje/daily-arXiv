| 2018-03-06 | [Lunar Crater Identification via Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02192) | + Applied Keras+TensorFlow on degital elevation data to identify craters <br> + Overfitting -- which will result good result on training data but poor result on new data -- need to be addressed carefully <br> + Has experimented the code on Mercury
| 2018-03-11 | [Delivery of organics to Mars through asteroid and comet impacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03270) | + Impacts made by known population of asteroids/comets account for 5-70% organics accretion (measured rate) on Mars <br> + Organics deposited by impacts distributed up to 150 km from the impact point
| 2018-03-11 | [Pre-MAP Search for Transiting Objects Orbiting White Dwarfs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03584) | + Use a 50 cm telescope to search for moon-sized objects (or larger) orbiting white dwarfs <br> + Transit depth by Earth-sized objects could be >50%, small telescopes could make a contribution <br> + Periods corresponding to tidal disruption around a white dwarf host is 3-10 hr
