| 2018-04-02 | [Asteroid families interacting with secular resonances](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00505) | + Secular resonances are hard to disentangle in a, e, sin i space but are easy to spot in angular elements between an asteroid and a massive object (large asteroid or major planet)
| 2018-04-02 | [Thermal evolution and sintering of chondritic planetesimals IV. Temperature dependence of heat conductivity of asteroids and meteorites](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00574) | + A model of heat conductivity of different chondritic materials in high temperature (>300 K)
| 2018-04-02 | [Astronomy and Feng Shui in the project of the Tang, Ming and Qing royal mausoleums: a satellite imagery approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00264) | + Magnetic compass did not influence the planning of ancient Chinese royal tombs (accounted for magnetic variation over time, though the accuracy of such model has not been discussed in the paper) <br> + Pre-Mongolian tombs follow astronomical orientations, while tombs of Ming follow Feng Shui doctrine and tombs of Qing show western influence
| 2018-04-03 | [Oscillations of cometary tails: a vortex shedding phenomenon?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00997) | + Studied the swaying-like motion exhibited by 2P/Encke and C/2012 S1 in STEREO/HI1 data <br> + Behavior of the comets is analogous to vortexes; therefore use Strouhal number to study it <br> + Strouhal number: describing oscillating flow mechanisms [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strouhal_number); while Reynolds number -- predicting flow patterns in different fluid flow <br> + Strouhal number determined from coma size, solar wind speed and oscilation feature in the tail is ~0.2, which is quite small; for comparison, Strouhal number in animal flight/swim is about 0.2 to 0.4 <br> + No clear vortex shedding, but future magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation can help reveal the physical conditions in the near-Sun region
| 2018-04-03 | [The need for a far-infrared cold space telescope to understand the chemistry of planet formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00743) | + H2O bending vibration -- 6 to 10 micron; H2O rotational feature -- 10 to 100 micron; HD rotational transition -- 112 micron. The latter two are very important for understandying planet formation because (1) HD is believed to be the most robust proxy of the protoplanetary disk mass (because it is a tracer of H2 which is also a proxy of deuterium) and (2) rotational spectrum tells environment temperature, etc. Lines at 1113 GHz and 557 GHz (0.27 mm, 0.54 mm) informs water abundance in 10-30 K region (comparable to Kuiper belt in the solar system) <br> + Origin Space Telescope will enable observation in 30 to 200 micron wavelength, high resolution spectroscopy (R~45000 to 200000) will fully resolve H2O rotational spectrum, HD line, 1113 and 557 GHz lines

| 2018-04-05 | [A compact and light-weight refractive telescope for the observation of extensive air showers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01781) | + Air showers are the decay of high energy cosmic particles in Earth's atmosphere, they produce fluorescence light and Cherenkov light (both in around 280 to 350 nm wavelength) which can be used as a marker to study these cosmic particles, but one needs wide field telescope to detect these lights (though sidereal tracking is not required) <br> + A major difference from typical optical telescopes is that Cherenkov telescopes use special detector sensitive to far UV light, the quantum effiency of a detector described in this paper is 35% at 440 nm <br> + Cherenkov Telescope Array, for example, is an array of multi-meter telescopes, each with segmented primary mirrors and a large field of view (10 deg^2 level) <br> This paper described the use of small (50-cm class, f/1.1), cheap (~10000 Euro) telescope to detect air showers <br> + The authors did not seem to describe an optimal number of telescopes needed to achieve scientifically useful result, but for comparison, the small telescope component at the Cherenkov Telescope Array has 70 4-m class telescopes

| 2018-04-10 | [Small impacts on the giant planet Jupiter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03006) | + A +3 magnitude flash could leave a detectable debris field; this is likely caused by a multi deca-meter wide object (energy released is ~10^16 J, while most recently-observed flashes were caused by 5-20 m objects and released 10^14 J energy) <br> + +3 mag flashes take place 0.4-2.6 times per year; impacts by 5-20 m sized object take place less than 120 times per year <br> + Next few years are good due to favourable geometry <br> + Software: [DeTeCt](http://www.astrosurf.com/planetessaf/doc/project_detect.php)
