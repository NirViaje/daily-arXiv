| 2018-04-01 | [Super-Earths in need for Extremly Big Rockets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11384) | + Good for some afternoon break exercise
| 2018-04-02 | [Asteroid families interacting with secular resonances](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00505) | + Secular resonances are hard to disentangle in a, e, sin i space but are easy to spot in angular elements between an asteroid and a massive object (large asteroid or major planet)
| 2018-04-02 | [Thermal evolution and sintering of chondritic planetesimals IV. Temperature dependence of heat conductivity of asteroids and meteorites](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00574) | + A model of heat conductivity of different chondritic materials in high temperature (>300 K)
| 2018-04-02 | [Astronomy and Feng Shui in the project of the Tang, Ming and Qing royal mausoleums: a satellite imagery approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00264) | + Magnetic compass did not influence the planning of ancient Chinese royal tombs (accounted for magnetic variation over time, though the accuracy of such model has not been discussed in the paper) <br> + Pre-Mongolian tombs follow astronomical orientations, while tombs of Ming follow Feng Shui doctrine and tombs of Qing show western influence
| 2018-04-03 | [Oscillations of cometary tails: a vortex shedding phenomenon?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00997) | + Studied the swaying-like motion exhibited by 2P/Encke and C/2012 S1 in STEREO/HI1 data <br> + Behavior of the comets is analogous to vortexes; therefore use Strouhal number to study it <br> + Strouhal number: describing oscillating flow mechanisms [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strouhal_number); while Reynolds number -- predicting flow patterns in different fluid flow <br> + Strouhal number determined from coma size, solar wind speed and oscilation feature in the tail is ~0.2, which is quite small; for comparison, Strouhal number in animal flight/swim is about 0.2 to 0.4 <br> + No clear vortex shedding, but future magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation can help reveal the physical conditions in the near-Sun region
| 2018-04-03 | [The need for a far-infrared cold space telescope to understand the chemistry of planet formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00743) | + H2O bending vibration -- 6 to 10 micron; H2O rotational transition -- 10 to 100 micron; HD rotational transition -- 112 micron. The latter two are very important for understandying planet formation because (1) HD is believed to be the most robust proxy of the protoplanetary disk mass (because it is a tracer of H2 which is also a proxy of deuterium) and (2)
