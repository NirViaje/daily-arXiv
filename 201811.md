| 2018-11-02 | [The threat of Centaurs for terrestrial planets and their orbital evolution as impactors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03209) | + After LHB, impacts from km-sized Centaurs occur every 10-50 Myr on terrestrial planets (besides Mercury which the authors did not investigate) <br> + Centaurs contribute 1e-5 amount of water to the Earth <br> + About half of the Centaurs enter the inner Solar System and 7% of them can interact with terrestrial planets; 6% eventually become sungrazers
| 2018-11-02 | [A Techno-Economic Analysis of Asteroid Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03836) | + Modeling the profitibility of asteroid mining assuming the goal of the mission is to supply water in space and return platinum to the Earth <br> + Find that using multiple small satellites will allow reaching breakeven quickly, but this assumes high efficiency in producing/launching satellites and high throughput in platinum mining (which both are difficult to achieve)
| 2018-11-02 | [The Tunguska Event Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07427) | + Atmospheric dynamical analysis and modeling of the Tunguska parent body <br> + Proposed that the Tunguska event was produced by a splitted rubble-pile asteroid, which one porous body evaporated upon entry and the other smaller but more solid one produced the depression at Lake Cheko
| 2018-11-02 | [Return to the Kuiper Belt: launch opportunities from 2025 to 2040](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07811) | + Lists of possible fly-bys to KBO objects with swingby via Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus or Neptune <br> + Dozens of launching opportunities to different targets <br> + Used a not-yet-released Python code (MAKO) which in turn use the SPICE Python wrapper, [SpiceyPy](https://github.com/AndrewAnnex/SpiceyPy)
| 2018-11-02 | [Death and Maier: meteors and mortuary rites in the eastern Torres Strait](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11276) | + Indigenous people live in the eastern Torres Strait believe bright meteors have important connection of death <br> + Historical review, and description of what the Meriam Mir people think about bright meteors and its associated phenomena (like fragmentation and sound)
| 2018-11-05 | [What mechanisms dominate the activity of Geminid Parent (3200) Phaethon?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00759) | + Used a thermal model to examine whether Phaethon can still have ice today, but they have to be below a 15-m thick dust mantle <br> + Since Geminids is only 1000 yr old, authors argued that the dust mantle of Phaethon was thin enough (like 1 m) 1000 yr ago, allowing the creation of Geminids <br> + Phaethon could be 100x more active 1000 yr ago, allowing ejection of cm-sized dust <br> + Authors calculated that presently near-surface (at a depth of 20 cm) mantle containing 0.2% ice could generate the observed outgassing rate observed by STEREO <br> + Authors conceded that the scenario they proposed requires Phaethon to reach its present orbit 1000 yr ago, which seems to have been rejected by dynamical studies, hence case not closed
| 2018-11-06 | [Time resolved spectroscopy of dust and gas from extrasolar planetesimals orbiting WD 1145+017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04657) | + High speed (every a couple second) spectroscopy using EMCCD on 4.2-m WHT, target WD 1145+017 is known to be a polluted WD, v=17.0, spectral setting R1200B at blue, R600R at red <br> + Revealed blue-ward excess (0.05-0.1 mag) and shallower absorption lines during transit, suggesting the existence of absorbing gas between the host star and the planet
| 2018-11-06 | [Colors of Centaurs observed by the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam and implications for their origin](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07459) | + Presented colors of (only) 9 Centaurs found in HSC public archive <br> + Colors of Centaurs are consistent with high inclination (over 6 deg) TNOs, distinct from "classical cold" TNOs (namely TNOs with inclination <6 deg)
| 2018-11-06 | [Recent advancements in the EST project](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00851) | + EST (European Solar Telescope) is a planned 4-m solar telescope in the Canary Islands to be installed on a 35-m tower <br> + EST will observe 380 nm to 2 micron simutaneously and will have imager and spectrograph (no further details), main goals are magnetic fields and features from deep convections
| 2018-11-06 | [Upgrading the processing pipeline for the National Park Service Night Skies Program](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01042) | + NPS has an array of mobile cameras in many (didn't say how many) of its parks to monitor sky brightness <br> + The old system relies on a number of commercial software (e.g. ACP, PixInsight, etc) for data reduction; authors have migrated to Python and codes are publicly available [here](https://github.com/liweihung/nightskies)
| 2018-11-06 | [Status of Astronomy in Namibia](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01440) | + Namibia has a small but prioritized and rapidly growing astronomy programs across all wavelengths; strong ties to South Africa
