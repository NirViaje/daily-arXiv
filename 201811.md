| 2018-11-02 | [A Techno-Economic Analysis of Asteroid Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03836) | + Modeling the profitibility of asteroid mining assuming the goal of the mission is to supply water in space and return platinum to the Earth <br> + Find that using multiple small satellites will allow reaching breakeven quickly, but this assumes high efficiency in producing/launching satellites and high throughput in platinum mining (which both are difficult to achieve)
| 2018-11-02 | [The Tunguska Event Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07427) | + Atmospheric dynamical analysis and modeling of the Tunguska parent body <br> + Proposed that the Tunguska event was produced by a splitted rubble-pile asteroid, which one porous body evaporated upon entry and the other smaller but more solid one produced the depression at Lake Cheko

| 2018-11-05 | [What mechanisms dominate the activity of Geminid Parent (3200) Phaethon?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00759) | + Used a thermal model to examine whether Phaethon can still have ice today, but they have to be below a 15-m thick dust mantle <br> + Since Geminids is only 1000 yr old, authors argued that the dust mantle of Phaethon was thin enough (like 1 m) 1000 yr ago, allowing the creation of Geminids <br> + Phaethon could be 100x more active 1000 yr ago, allowing ejection of cm-sized dust <br> + Authors calculated that presently near-surface (at a depth of 20 cm) mantle containing 0.2% ice could generate the observed outgassing rate observed by STEREO <br> + Authors conceded that the scenario they proposed requires Phaethon to reach its present orbit 1000 yr ago, which seems to have been rejected by dynamical studies, hence case not closed
| 2018-11-06 | [Time resolved spectroscopy of dust and gas from extrasolar planetesimals orbiting WD 1145+017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04657) | + High speed (every a couple second) spectroscopy using EMCCD on 4.2-m WHT, target WD 1145+017 is known to be a polluted WD, v=17.0, spectral setting R1200B at blue, R600R at red <br> + Revealed blue-ward excess (0.05-0.1 mag) and shallower absorption lines during transit, suggesting the existence of absorbing gas between the host star and the planet
| 2018-11-06 | [Colors of Centaurs observed by the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam and implications for their origin](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07459) | + Presented colors of (only) 9 Centaurs found in HSC public archive <br> + Colors of Centaurs are consistent with high inclination (over 6 deg) TNOs, distinct from "classical cold" TNOs (namely TNOs with inclination <6 deg)
| 2018-11-06 | [Recent advancements in the EST project](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00851) | + EST (European Solar Telescope) is a planned 4-m solar telescope in the Canary Islands to be installed on a 35-m tower <br> + EST will observe 380 nm to 2 micron simutaneously and will have imager and spectrograph (no further details), main goals are magnetic fields and features from deep convections
| 2018-11-06 | [Upgrading the processing pipeline for the National Park Service Night Skies Program](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01042) | + NPS has an array of mobile cameras in many (didn't say how many) of its parks to monitor sky brightness <br> + The old system relies on a number of commercial software (e.g. ACP, PixInsight, etc) for data reduction; authors have migrated to Python and codes are publicly available [here](https://github.com/liweihung/nightskies)
| 2018-11-06 | [Status of Astronomy in Namibia](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01440) | + Namibia has a small but prioritized and rapidly growing astronomy programs across all wavelengths; strong ties to South Africa
| 2018-11-19 | [AKARI/IRC Near-Infrared Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey: AcuA-spec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03828) | + Grism observations of 66 asteroids using the IRC camera on AKARI, this covers 2.5 to 5 micron <br> + Most asteroids have numbers below 1000, except (4015) Wilson-Harrington <br> + Most importantly, AKARI (or any space-based observatory) can observe 2.5-2.85 micron which is inaccessible from ground; the 2.75 micron absorption, related to hydrated minerals, lies in this region <br> + This work found clear relation between 2.75 micron feature and taxonomy groups: most C-type has it, no S-type has it <br> + (4015), a B-type, does not have 2.75 micron feature; authors think that it is because being an NEO, (4015) is relatively warm, and surface may be dehydrated
| 2018-11-19 | [Extreme asteroids in the Pan-STARRS 1 Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11668) | + Tracked high-amplitude asteroids found by PS1: 22 of them (out of 33 identified) <br> + 4 of them have amplitude over 1 mag, did some intensive observation and modeling, and found none of them needs unusual internal cohesive strength for explanation <br> + Statistics suggests that 0.01% objects in the PS1 discoveries have high amplitudes
| 2018-11-19 | [Can Moons Have Moons?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03304) | + Yes but very rare. However, if moon-moons are found, they can provide important clue to the dynamical history of the system (since it is unusual for them to be found)
