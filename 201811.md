| 2018-11-02 | [A Techno-Economic Analysis of Asteroid Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03836) | + Modeling the profitibility of asteroid mining assuming the goal of the mission is to supply water in space and return platinum to the Earth <br> + Find that using multiple small satellites will allow reaching breakeven quickly, but this assumes high efficiency in producing/launching satellites and high throughput in platinum mining (which both are difficult to achieve)
| 2018-11-02 | [The Tunguska Event Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07427) | + Atmospheric dynamical analysis and modeling of the Tunguska parent body <br> + Proposed that the Tunguska event was produced by a splitted rubble-pile asteroid, which one porous body evaporated upon entry and the other smaller but more solid one produced the depression at Lake Cheko

| 2018-11-05 | [What mechanisms dominate the activity of Geminid Parent (3200) Phaethon?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00759) | + Used a thermal model to examine whether Phaethon can still have ice today, but they have to be below a 15-m thick dust mantle <br> + Since Geminids is only 1000 yr old, authors argued that the dust mantle of Phaethon was thin enough (like 1 m) 1000 yr ago, allowing the creation of Geminids <br> + Phaethon could be 100x more active 1000 yr ago, allowing ejection of cm-sized dust <br> + Authors calculated that presently near-surface (at a depth of 20 cm) mantle containing 0.2% ice could generate the observed outgassing rate observed by STEREO <br> + Authors conceded that the scenario they proposed requires Phaethon to reach its present orbit 1000 yr ago, which seems to have been rejected by dynamical studies, hence case not closed
| 2018-11-06 | [Time resolved spectroscopy of dust and gas from extrasolar planetesimals orbiting WD 1145+017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04657) | + High speed (every a couple second) spectroscopy using EMCCD on 4.2-m WHT, target WD 1145+017 is known to be a polluted WD, v=17.0, spectral setting R1200B at blue, R600R at red <br> + Revealed blue-ward excess (0.05-0.1 mag) and shallower absorption lines during transit, suggesting the existence of absorbing gas between the host star and the planet

| 2018-11-25 | [Evidence for Very Early Migration of the Solar System Planets from the Patroclus-Menoetius binary Jupiter Trojan](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04007) | + Dynamical history of Patroclus-Menoetius, a Jupiter Trojan binary system, and its implication <br> + P-M at its birth place in the Kuiper belt is dynamically unstable, therefore it should have been implanted into the Trojan region very early, quantitative analysis of multiple dynamical simulation shows the system arrived in the Trojan region no later than 100 Myr after its formation <br> + This implies the planetary migration (which is responsible for the migration of the P-M system) should started earlier than earlier thought, which becomes inconsistent with the time of the Late Heavy Bombardment <br> + Proposed that most of the LHB impactors were originated in the terrestrial planet region as they are irrelevant to the planetary migration
