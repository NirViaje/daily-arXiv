| 2018-12-05 | [Investigation of surface homogeneity of (3200) Phaethon](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01851) | + Conducted spectrometry and spectroscopy to look for longitudinal variation; no detection <br> + Used meteorite heating experiment to discuss whether Phaethon could have longitudinal variation, concluded that the surface of Phaethon is largely homogeneous
| 2018-12-05 | [Monitoring the optical turbulence in the surface layer at Dome C, Antarctica, with sonic anemometers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07585) | + Confirmed that the boundary layer during winter is as thin as 35-m
| 2018-12-05 | [A machine--vision method for automatic classification of stellar halo substructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10613) | + The centerpiece is the Subspaced-Constrained Mean Shift algorithm which is designed to automatically detect blob features, a similar sklearn function is [cluster.MeanShift](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.MeanShift.html) <br> + The algorithm will identify substructures along the "ridge" of the halo <br> + The algorithm is tested on simulated data and the identified features are sensible -- the algorithm is best used in future big survey data
