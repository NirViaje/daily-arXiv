| 2018-05-02 | [Dust modelling and a dynamical study of comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak during its 2017 perihelion passage](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00493) | + Dust modeling of 41P during its 2017 perihelion, plus dynamical investigation <br> + Clone evolution figure (Figure 13) looks nice; clones are shown in half-transparent light grey <br> + Dust model (with a simple assumption of lit-side ejection, as well as isotropic ejection) hard to fully explain the observations, implying most dust comes from jet area <br> + Dynamical simulation suggests a dynamical lifetime of a few 10^3 years, but the comet may not live that long considering its activeness (many recently-observed outbursts)
| 2018-05-03 | [A new approach to distant solar system object detection in large survey data sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01203) | + Searching aligned detections assuming heliocentric distance is constant; most useful when data is sparse
| 2018-05-03 | [Monitoring near-Earth-object discoveries for imminent impactors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01315) | + Described the NEORANGER software for impact prediction similar to JPL's Sentry service <br> + Three ranging algorithm: statistical, MCMC, random walk
| 2018-05-03 | [Technical Note: Asteroid Detection Demonstration from SkySat-3 B612 Data using Synthetic Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01102) | + SkySat-3: commercial Earth-observation satellite, 35-cm aperture, 16' FoV <br> + RMS pointing jitter about 1 arcsec, need synthetic technique to properly align stars <br> + Single-frame limiting magnitude ~13, stacking 2500 frames can reach 16.5 (SNR=6.5)
| 2018-05-03 | [Accurate Ground-based Near-Earth-Asteroid Astrometry using Synthetic Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01107) | + Synthetic tracking enable very precise astrometry for faint and fast-moving objects, reaching roughly 1/4 of pixel size (100 mas for this work); but (my comment) isn't necessary better than streak PSF fitting
| 2018-05-07 | [Debiased orbit and absolute-magnitude distributions for near-Earth objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10265) | + Documented version of the model described in Jedicke et al. (2015, Asteroids IV) and Granvik et al. (2016, Nature), flat-file access available <br> + 2-10% JFC content depending on absolute magnitude H, however does not account for JFC elimination due to physical cause (spin-up disruption, etc) <br> + NEA average dynamical lifetime varies with respect to H, H=17 and 25 has about 10 Myr while H=20 has 6 Myr <br> + Impact rates for 24<H<28 (Tunguska-sized impact) still unsettled: observation suggests a bump 10x higher in flux with respected to the model prediction <br> + Impacts from NEAs of H<24 and H>28 agree well with observations (lunar craters, bolides) <br> + Confirms that NEA population is in steady state, because this model (which assumes so) agrees well with observations
| 2018-05-07 | [Major Outcomes of an Authentic Astronomy Research Experience Professional Development Program: An Analysis of 8 Years of Data from NITARP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01387) | + Survey of educators who received NITARP; input based on analysis of written feedbacks
| 2018-05-07 | [ DISCUS - The Deep Interior Scanning CubeSat mission to a rubble pile near-Earth asteroid](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01750) | + 6U sat caontaining 1U for radar, 1U for communication, 2U for propulsion, and star trackers, camera, reaction wheels etc <br> + Radar is a stepped frequency radar working in 20-50 MHz, 40 W input power and 10 W transmitting power <br> + Total mass 12 kg, power requirement about 200 W <br> + Communication: 3 W RF power at up to 20 lunar distances, need a 35 m dish to achieve a data rate of 500 kbit/s
| 2018-05-09 | [Finding Asteroids Down the Back of the Couch: A Novel Approach to the Minor Planet Linking Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02638) | + Transform orbits to the same epoch, then search for clustering of some proxies of the state vectors <br> + Clustering of tracklets scales more efficiently than conventional linkage method (projection of a set of 3 tracklets)
| 2018-05-09 | [Appraising Human Impact on Watersheds: The Feasibility of Training Citizen Scientists to make Qualitative Judgments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01894) | + Argues that low-skill tasks do not suit the need for most citizen scientists <br> + To train them to do higher-skill tasks such as making qualitative judgments, they need to experience a diverse range of streams, get connected to other citizen scientists doing the same tasks, and form their own narratives about the task 
| 2018-05-09 | [Unconfirmed Near-Earth Asteroids](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02804) | + In the period of 2013 to 2016, 11% NEO Confirmation Page objects were not follow-up; about 50% of them are likely real NEAs. This represents 18% of discovered NEAs in that period <br> + Delayed submission is the dominated factor on why those NEAs were lost; high motion rate also has some effect <br> + Lost NEAs tend to have more than 10 hr of submission delay; lost NEAs tend to have motion rate of 20 deg/day (50"/min) or more <br> + Absolute magnitude H of the lost NEAs are derived using MCMC (my note: need to check details)
| 2018-05-09 | [Bi-lobed Shape of Comet 67P from a Collapsed Binary](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08735) | + Assumes 67P formed as a binary in the Kuiper belt and simulates its evolution, showed that this scenario is possible <br> + Streaming instability is capable of forming the observed size distribution of small (<~100 km) Kuiper belt objects and Jovian Trojans
| 2018-05-14 | [The Sublimative Torques of Jupiter Family Comets and Mass Wasting Events on Their Nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10232) | + Examined two paramterized sublimative torque models <br> + Found that number of emitted molecules is largely not related to shape and activity of the nucleus, but related to nuclear size and heliocentric distance <br> + Argued that most cometary activities are contributed by steep surface that effectively expose fresh areas and trigger "mass wasting" (it seems that this is equivalent to "outburst" defined by observers) <br> + Proposed to use the intervals between frequency of mass wasting and physical lifetime to classify comets: quasi-equilibrium, episodic, quasi-dormant
| 2018-05-14 | [Solar wind dynamics around a comet - A 2D semi-analytical kinetic model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03459) | + Devloped a 2D semi-analytical model to describe motional electric field around a comet, showed that it works on Rosetta data <br> + My question: since solar wind is well understood, can we use this to derive some information of the comet itself?
| 2018-05-14 | [Astronomers' and Physicists' Attitudes Towards Education & Public Outreach: A Case Study with The Dark Energy Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04034) | + Conducted a survey of scientists (physicists and astronomers) to find out their altitude to E/PO <br> + Lacking of time is the main reason that turn scientists away from E/PO, but cutural stigma ("Sagan effect") is also a factor
