| 2018-05-03 | [Technical Note: Asteroid Detection Demonstration from SkySat-3 B612 Data using Synthetic Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01102) | + SkySat-3: commercial Earth-observation satellite, 35-cm aperture, 16' FoV <br> + RMS pointing jitter about 1 arcsec, need synthetic technique to properly align stars <br> + Single-frame limiting magnitude ~13, stacking 2500 frames can reach 16.5 (SNR=6.5)
| 2018-05-03 | [Accurate Ground-based Near-Earth-Asteroid Astrometry using Synthetic Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01107) | + Synthetic tracking enable very precise astrometry for faint and fast-moving objects, reaching roughly 1/4 of pixel size (100 mas for this work); but (my comment) isn't necessary better than streak PSF fitting
| 2018-05-07 | [Debiased orbit and absolute-magnitude distributions for near-Earth objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10265) | + Documented version of the model described in Jedicke et al. (2015, Asteroids IV) and Granvik et al. (2016, Nature), flat-file access available <br> + 2-10% JFC content depending on absolute magnitude H, however does not account for JFC elimination due to physical cause (spin-up disruption, etc) <br> + NEA average dynamical lifetime varies with respect to H, H=17 and 25 has about 10 Myr while H=20 has 6 Myr <br> + Impact rates for 24<H<28 (Tunguska-sized impact) still unsettled: observation suggests a bump 10x higher in flux with respected to the model prediction <br> + Impacts from NEAs of H<24 and H>28 agree well with observations (lunar craters, bolides) <br> + Confirms that NEA population is in steady state, because this model (which assumes so) agrees well with observations
| 2018-05-07 | [Major Outcomes of an Authentic Astronomy Research Experience Professional Development Program: An Analysis of 8 Years of Data from NITARP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01387) | + Survey of educators who received NITARP; input based on analysis of written feedbacks
| 2018-05-07 | [ DISCUS - The Deep Interior Scanning CubeSat mission to a rubble pile near-Earth asteroid](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01750) | + 6U sat caontaining 1U for radar, 1U for communication, 2U for propulsion, and star trackers, camera, reaction wheels etc <br> + Radar is a stepped frequency radar working in 20-50 MHz, 40 W input power and 10 W transmitting power <br> + Total mass 12 kg, power requirement about 200 W <br> + Communication: 3 W RF power at up to 20 lunar distances, need a 35 m dish to achieve a data rate of 500 kbit/s

| 2018-05-09 | [Unconfirmed Near-Earth Asteroids](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02804) | + In the period of 2013 to 2016, 11% NEO Confirmation Page objects were not follow-up; about 50% of them are likely real NEAs. This represents 18% of discovered NEAs in that period <br> + Delayed submission is the dominated factor on why those NEAs were lost; high motion rate also has some effect <br> + Lost NEAs tend to have more than 10 hr of submission delay; lost NEAs tend to have motion rate of 20 deg/day (50"/min) or more <br> + Absolute magnitude H of the lost NEAs are derived using MCMC (my note: need to check details)

| 2018-05-14 | [Astronomers' and Physicists' Attitudes Towards Education & Public Outreach: A Case Study with The Dark Energy Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04034) | + Conducted a survey of scientists (physicists and astronomers) to find out their altitude to E/PO <br> + Lacking of time is the main reason that turn scientists away from E/PO, but cutural stigma ("Sagan effect") is also a factor <br> + Needs more support from high-level people (either from the administration of scientific body or E/PO body)
| 2018-05-18 | [Toward Understanding the Origin of Asteroid Geometries: Variety in Shapes Produced by Equal-Mass Impacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11039) | + Used Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code to simulate low velocity (40-500 m/s) impacts, found that a variety of asteroid shapes can be reproduced

| 2018-05-18 | [Using Deep Space Climate Observatory Measurements to Study the Earth as An Exoplanet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05834) | + Reduced two years of DSCOVR data into a single-point series data, perform analysis similar to what is being used to study exoplanets, and compared the results to known values <br> + Can reproduce Earth's cloud/surface signatures, rotation, orbit, surface type signatures, etc <br> + Caveat: exoplanet may have completely different atmospheric composition, mass, surface features than the Earth, however techniques still applicable to exoplanets with similar features (e.g. liquids different than water, large cyclone system like Giant Red Spot on Jupiter, etc)
| 2018-05-18 | [Tidal Features at 0.05<z<0.45 in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program: Properties and Formation Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05970) | + Identification of faint, arc-like features near galaxies in deep HSC fields that could indicate tidal disruption events <br> + Completed to ~29 mag/arcsec^2, but earlier work suggested that most of the tidal disruption features are beyond 30 mag/arcsec^2 <br> + Key is to separate high pass signals (interested features) from low pass signals (galaxy light), authors gradually smooth-out the images by iteratively convolute the images with a B-spline kernal and recorded the difference between successive images; regions that are positive on one or more of these difference images means that there are transitions from unsharp to sharp regime and therefore likely to contain features we are interested in
| 2018-05-21 | [Comparison of the orbital properties of Jupiter Trojan asteroids and Trojan dust](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04932) | + Most dust particles released by Jupiter Trojans are trapped in the 1:1 resonance; studied are 1-10 micron-sized dusts <br> + Orbital distribution of 1 micron dust is slightly different from larger dust due to radiation effect <br> + Dynamics of the dusts are stable to ~10 kyr, possibly longer but not studied by this work

| 2018-05-25 | [The Reclassification of Asteroids from Planets to Non-Planets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04115) | + Asteroids are not planets not (only) because they cannot clear out their orbits, but also (mainly) because they are geophysically different from planets. Criticize the IAU for deciding this reclassification by voting
| 2018-05-25 | [The optical characteristics of the dust of sungrazing comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) observed at large heliocentric distances](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06710) | + Some decent imaging and optical spectral observation of C/2012 S1 (ISON) <br> + Attempted to calculate Af\rho using different assumption, showed that materials with different chemical properties (shown here are Ballistic Agglomeration and BA with 2 Migrations) can lead to 10x difference in dust production rate estimates
