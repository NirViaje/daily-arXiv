| 2018-05-02 | [Dust modelling and a dynamical study of comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak during its 2017 perihelion passage](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00493) | + Dust modeling of 41P during its 2017 perihelion, plus dynamical investigation <br> + Clone evolution figure (Figure 13) looks nice; clones are shown in half-transparent light grey <br> + Dust model (with a simple assumption of lit-side ejection, as well as isotropic ejection) hard to fully explain the observations, implying most dust comes from jet area <br> + Dynamical simulation suggests a dynamical lifetime of a few 10^3 years, but the comet may not live that long considering its activeness (many recently-observed outbursts)
| 2018-05-03 | [A new approach to distant solar system object detection in large survey data sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01203) | + Searching aligned detections assuming heliocentric distance is constant; most useful when data is sparse
| 2018-05-03 | [Monitoring near-Earth-object discoveries for imminent impactors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01315) | + Described the NEORANGER software for impact prediction similar to JPL's Sentry service <br> + Three ranging algorithm: statistical, MCMC, random walk
| 2018-05-03 | [Technical Note: Asteroid Detection Demonstration from SkySat-3 B612 Data using Synthetic Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01102) | + SkySat-3: commercial Earth-observation satellite, 35-cm aperture, 16' FoV <br> + RMS pointing jitter about 1 arcsec, need synthetic technique to properly align stars <br> + Single-frame limiting magnitude ~13, stacking 2500 frames can reach 16.5 (SNR=6.5)
| 2018-05-03 | [Accurate Ground-based Near-Earth-Asteroid Astrometry using Synthetic Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01107) | + Synthetic tracking enable very precise astrometry for faint and fast-moving objects, reaching roughly 1/4 of pixel size (100 mas for this work); but (my comment) isn't necessary better than streak PSF fitting <br> +
