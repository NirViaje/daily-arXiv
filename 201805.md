| 2018-05-02 | [Dust modelling and a dynamical study of comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak during its 2017 perihelion passage](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00493) | + Dust modeling of 41P during its 2017 perihelion, plus dynamical investigation <br> + Clone evolution figure (Figure 13) looks nice; clones are shown in half-transparent light grey <br> + Dust model (with a simple assumption of lit-side ejection, as well as isotropic ejection) hard to fully explain the observations, implying most dust comes from jet area <br> + Dynamical simulation suggests a dynamical lifetime of a few 10^3 years, but the comet may not live that long considering its activeness (many recently-observed outbursts)
| 2018-05-03 | [A new approach to distant solar system object detection in large survey data sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01203) | + Searching aligned detections assuming heliocentric distance is constant; most useful when data is sparse
| 2018-05-03 | [Monitoring near-Earth-object discoveries for imminent impactors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01315) | + Described the NEORANGER software for impact prediction similar to JPL's Sentry service <br> + Three ranging algorithm: statistical, MCMC, random walk
| 2018-05-03 | [Technical Note: Asteroid Detection Demonstration from SkySat-3 B612 Data using Synthetic Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01102) | + SkySat-3: commercial Earth-observation satellite, 35-cm aperture, 16' FoV <br> + RMS pointing jitter about 1 arcsec, need synthetic technique to properly align stars <br> + Single-frame limiting magnitude ~13, stacking 2500 frames can reach 16.5 (SNR=6.5)
| 2018-05-03 | [Accurate Ground-based Near-Earth-Asteroid Astrometry using Synthetic Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01107) | + Synthetic tracking enable very precise astrometry for faint and fast-moving objects, reaching roughly 1/4 of pixel size (100 mas for this work); but (my comment) isn't necessary better than streak PSF fitting
| 2018-05-07 | [Debiased orbit and absolute-magnitude distributions for near-Earth objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10265) | + Documented version of the model described in Jedicke et al. (2015, Asteroids IV) and Granvik et al. (2016, Nature), flat-file access available <br> + 2-10% JFC content depending on absolute magnitude H, however does not account for JFC elimination due to physical cause (spin-up disruption, etc) <br> + NEA average dynamical lifetime varies with respect to H, H=17 and 25 has about 10 Myr while H=20 has 6 Myr <br> + Impact rates for 24<H<28 (Tunguska-sized impact) still unsettled: observation suggests a bump 10x higher in flux with respected to the model prediction <br> + Impacts from NEAs of H<24 and H>28 agree well with observations (lunar craters, bolides) <br> + Confirms that NEA population is in steady state, because this model (which assumes so) agrees well with observations

| 2018-05-07 | [ DISCUS - The Deep Interior Scanning CubeSat mission to a rubble pile near-Earth asteroid](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01750) | + 6U sat caontaining 1U for radar, 1U for communication, 2U for propulsion, and star trackers, camera, reaction wheels etc <br> + Radar is a stepped frequency radar working in 20-50 MHz, 40 W input power and 10 W transmitting power <br> + Total mass 12 kg, power requirement about 200 W <br> + Communication: 3 W RF power at up to 20 lunar distances, need a 35 m dish to achieve a data rate of 500 kbit/s
